The race that long in darkness pined
  Have ssen a glorious light;
The people dwell in day, who dwelt
  In death's surrounding night.
  
To hail thy rise, thou better Sun,
  The gathering nations come,
Joyous as when the reapers bear
  The harvest-treasures home.
  
To us a Child of hope is born,
  To us a Son is given'
Him shall the tribes of earth obey,
  Him all the hosts of heav'n.
  
His name shall be the Prince of Peace,
  For evermore adored;
The Wonderful, the Counsellor,
  The great and mighty Lord.
  
His power increasing still shall spread;
  His reign no end shall know:
Justice shall guard his throne above,
  And peace abound below.
  
John Morison (1750-1798)
based on ISAIAH 9:2-7
