Alphonsus de’ Liguori (1696-1787);
tr. Edmund Vaughan (1827-1908)

O Bread of Heav’n, beneath this veil
Thou dost my very God conceal:
My Jesus, dearest treasure, hail!
I love thee and, adoring, kneel;
Each loving soul by thee is fed
With thine own Self in form of Bread.

O food of life, thou Who dost give
The pledge of immortality;
I live, no ’tis not I that live;
God gives me life, God lives in me:
He feeds my soul, he guides my ways,
And ev’ry grief with joy repays.

O Bond of love that dost unite
The servant to his living Lord;
Could I dare live and not requite
Such love— then death were meet reward:
I cannot live unless to prove
Some love for such unmeasured love.

Belovèd Lord, in Heav’n above
There, Jesus, thou awaitest me,
To gaze on thee with endless love;
Yes, thus I hope, thus shall it be:
For how can he deny me Heav’n,
Who here on earth himself hath giv’n?
