Jesu, Rex admirabilis, 11th cent
Christ the King. Office of Readings
tr. Edward Caswall

O Jesus, King most wonderful,
Thou Conqueror renowned,
Thou sweetness most ineffable,
In whom all joys are found!

When once thou visitest the heart,
Then truth begins to shine;
Then earthly vanities depart;
Then kindles love divine.

O Jesus! Light of all below!
Thou Fount of life and fire,
Surpassing all thejoys we know,
And all we can desire:

May every heart confess thy name,
And ever thee adore;
And, seeking thee, itself inflame
To seek thee more and more.

Thee may our tongues for ever bless,
Thee may we love alone;
And ever in our lives express
The image of thine own.

(for the office hymn)
O Jesu! spotless virgin-flower!
Our life and joy! to thee
Be praise, beatitude, and power
Through all eternity.
