Jam desinant suspiria, Charles Coffin (1676-1749); 
tr. William John Blew (1808-1894)

Let sighing cease and woe,
God from on high hath heard,
Heav’n’s gate is op’ning wide, and lo!
The long-expected Word.

Peace! through the deep of night
The heav’nly choir breaks forth,
Singing, with festal songs and bright,
Our God and Savior’s birth.

The cave of Bethlehem
These wakeful shepherds seek:
Let us too rise and greet with them
That infant pure and meek.

We enter at the door
What marvel meets the eye?
A crib, a mother pale and poor,
A child of poverty.

Art thou the_eternal Son,
The_eternal Father’s ray?
Whose little hand, thou infant one,
Doth lift the world alway?

Yea– faith through that dim cloud,
Like lightning, darts before,
And greets thee, at whose footstool bowed
Heav’n’s trembling hosts adore.

Chaste be our love like thine;
Our swelling souls bring low,
And in our hearts, O Babe divine
Be born, abide, and grow.

So shall thy birthday morn,
Lord Christ, our birthday be,
Then greet we all, ourselves new-born,
Our King’s nativity.
