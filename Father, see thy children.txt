William Henry Hammond Jervois (1852-1905) and William Bouverie Trevelyan (1853-1929)

Father, see thy children bending at thy throne,
Pleading here the Passion of thine only Son,
Pleading here before thee all his dying love,
As he pleads it ever in the courts above.

Not for our wants only we this Offering plead,
But for all thy children who thy mercy need:
Bless thy faithful people, win thy wandâ€™ring sheep,
Keep the souls departed who in Jesus sleep.
