Adesto, santa Trinitas, c. 10th cent.; tr. John Mason Neale (1818-1866)

Be present, Holy Trinity,
Like splendor, and one Deity;
Of things above, and things below,
Beginning, that no end shall know.

Thee all the armies of the sky
Adore, and laud, and magnify;
And nature, in her triple frame,
For ever sanctifies thy name.

And we, too, thanks and homage pay,
Thine own adoring flock today;
O join to that celestial song
The praises of our suppliant throng!

Light, sole and one, we thee confess,
With triple praise we rightly bless;
Alpha and Omega we own,
With every spirit round thy throne.

To thee, O unbegotten One,
And thee, O sole-begotten Son,
And thee, O Holy Ghost, we raise
Our equal and eternal praise.
Amen.
