Brich an, o schönes Morgenlicht, J. von Rist (1607-1667), 1641; tr. J Troutbeck (1832-1899), 1873

Break forth, O beauteous heavenly light
And usher in the morning;
Ye shepherds, shrink not with affright,
But hear the angel’s warning.

This Child, now weak in infancy,
Our confidence and joy shall be,
The power of Satan breaking,
Our peace eternal making.
