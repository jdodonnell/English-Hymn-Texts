Pange, lingua, gloriosi proelium certaminis, Venantius Fortunatus (c. 530-600);
Tr. Percy Dearmer (1867-1936) and John Mason Neale (1818-1866)

Sing, my tongue, the glorious battle, 
Sing the ending of the fray;
Now above the Cross, the trophy, 
Sound the loud triumphant lay:
Tell how Christ, the world’s Redeemer,
As a Victim won the day.

God in pity saw man fallen,
Shamed and sunk in misery,
When he fell on death by tasting
Fruit of the forbidden tree;
Then another tree was chosen
Which the world from death should free.

Thus the scheme of our salvation
Was of old in order laid,
That the manifold deceiver’s 
Art by art might be outweighed,
And the lure the foe put forward 
Into means of healing made.

Therefore when the_appointed fullness
Of the holy time was come,
He was sent who maketh all things
Forth from God’s eternal home;
Thus he came to earth, incarnate,
Offspring of a maiden’s womb.

Lo! he lies, an infant weeping,
Where the narrow manger stands:
While the Mother-maid his members 
Wraps in mean and lowly bands:
And the swaddling clothes are winding
Round God’s helpless feet and hands.

Thirty years among us dwelling,
His appointed time fulfilled,
Born for this, he meets his Passion
For that this he freely willed,
On the Cross the Lamb is lifted
Where his life-blood shall be spilled.

He endured the nails, the spitting, 
Vinegar, and spear, and reed;
From that holy Body broken
Blood and water forth proceed:
Earth, and stars, and sky, and ocean
By that flood from stain are freed.

Bend thy boughs, O Tree of Glory!
Thy relaxing sinews bend;
For awhile the ancient rigor
That thy birth bestowed, suspend;
And the King of heav’nly beauty
On thy bosom gently tend!

Thou alone was counted worhty
This world’s ransom to uphold;
For a shipwreck’d race preparing
Harbor, like the Ark of old;
With the sacred Blood anointed 
From the smitten Lamb that rolled.

To the Trinity be glory
Everlasting, as is meet;
Equal to the Father, equal
To the Son, and Paraclete:
Trinal Unity, whose praises
All created things repeat.
