Deus ignee fons animarum, Prudentius (348-413), 4th cent.; 
tr. Percy Dearmer (1867-1936), 1906

Father of spirits, whose divine control
Doth bind the soul and body into one,
Thou wilt restore this body now undone; 
For once it was the mansion of a soul,
Where dwelt the glowing wisdom of thy Son.

Thou, Maker of the body, dost ordain
That this thine image, moulded by thy will,
Our ev’ry hope in glory shall fulfill;
So, till the body thou dost build again,
Thou wilt preserve the spirit freed from ill.

In that blest region shall this spirit dwell
Where flow’rs undying bloom on ev’ry side:
For, lo, we trust thy word, O Crucified,
When in thy triumph over deatha nd hell,
The thief forgiven took thee for his guide.

Our brother goeth by the shining way,
That ever to the faithful open lies:
Lord, train thy servant now in Paradise,
And bless him in his fatherland, we pray,
Till thou shalt bid his body to arise.
