Te saeculorum Principem.
Christ the King. Vespers
St Cecilia’s Abbey

O Christ, the Ruler of all time,
You hold the world beneath your sway.
As Judge supreme of ev’ry soul
We offer you our hearts this day.

Before your throne the angels sing
And down in adoration fall,
We praise you withour heart’s delight,
Proclaiming you the King of all.

O Christ, our Shepherd, Prince of Peace,
Our rebel hearts and minds subdue,
And draw the sheep that roam astray,
Within the fold, at one with you.

For this you hung upon the Tree,
With saving arms extended wide;
To prove the measure of your love
That cruel lance would pierce your side.

Upon our altars you descend,
Beneath the forms of bread and wine,
That we may our salvation win,
And even share your life divine.

All glory, Jesus, be to you,
Who with the Father reign above,
Who with the Spirit rule all things
With infinite and wondrous love.
Amen.
