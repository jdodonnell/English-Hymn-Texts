Aeterne Rex altissime, c. 5th cent.;
tr. J.M. Neale (1818-1866), 1852

Eternal Monarch, King most high,
Whose Blood hath brought redemption nigh,
By whom the death of Death was wrought,
And conqu’ring Grace’s battle fought:

Ascending to the throne of might, 
And seated at the FAther’s right,
All pow’r in heav’n is Jesus’ own,
That here his manhood had not known.

That so, in nature’s triple frame,
Each heav’nly and each earthly name,
And things in hell’s abyss abhorred,
May bend the knee and own him Lord.

Yea, Angels tremble when they see
How changed is our humanity;
That flesh hath purged what flesh had stained,
And God, the Flesh of God, hath reigned.

Be thou our joy and stron defence,
Who art our future recompense:
So shall the light that springs from thee
Be ours through all eternity.

O risen Christ, ascended Lord,
All praise to thee let earth accord,
Who art, while endless ages run,
With Father and with Spirit One.
