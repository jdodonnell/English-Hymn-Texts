Iesus refulsit omnium, Hilary of Poitiers
Baptism of the Lord. Lauds
tr. St. Cecilia’s Abbey, Hymns for the Liturgy of the Hours, 1979

Let ev’ry nation sing for joy,
The world’s Redeemer stands revealed;
The Man Christ Jesus, truly God, 
Begins his public life on earth.

With thirty years of human life,
He humbly comes to Jordan’s stream,
And seeks the cleansing water’s touch,
though essence of all purity.

The holy Baptist, filled will awe,
Declares his own unworthiness
To bathe in penitential rite
The Lamb of God who saves the world.

But lo, the Father’s voice is heard
To claim the Son of perfect Love,
The Spirit, Giver of all gifts,
Reveals his presence at this hour.

With earnest voice, O Lord, we pray,
Protect us from the stains of sin,
And purify our souls anew
That in our hearts your love may reign.

All glory be to you, O Christ, 
Who are the Life, the Truth alone;
The Father and the Spirit’s light
On high, revealed you as their own. Amen.
