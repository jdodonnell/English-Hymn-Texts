Ave, maris stella, c. 8th cent.;
tr. Athelstan Riley 

Hail, O Star that pointest
Towards the port of heaven,
Thou to whom as maiden
God for Son was given.

When the salutation
Gabriel had spoken,
Peace was shed upon us,
Eva’s bonds were broken.

Bound by Satan’s fetters,
Health and vision needing,
God will aid and light us
At thy gentle pleading.

Jesus tender Mother,
Make thy supplication
Unto him who chose thee
At his Incarnation.

That, O matchless Maiden,
Passing meek and lowly,
Thy dear Son may make us
Blameless, chaste and holy.

So, as now we journey,
Aid our weak endeavor,
Till we gaze on Jesus,
And rejoice for ever.

Father, Son, and Spirit,
Three in One confessing,
Give we equal glory,
Equal praise and blessing.
