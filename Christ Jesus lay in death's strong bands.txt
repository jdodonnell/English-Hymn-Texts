Christ lag in Todesbanden, Martin Luther (1483-1546), 1524; tr. R Massie (1800-1887), Martin Luther’s Spiritual Songs

Christ Jesus lay in Death’s strong bands,
For our offences given;
But now at God’s right hand he stands,
And brings us life from heaven:
Wherefore let us joyful be, 
And sing to God right thankfully
Loud songs of Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!

No man from Daath could vict’ry win,
O’er all mankind he reigned;
Alas! that cometh of our sin,
There was not one unstained:
Wherefore Death in triumph came,
And over us a right did claim;
He held us all in thraldom.
Hallelujah!

Christ Jesus, God’s own Son, came down,
That he might us deliver,
And sin destroying, took his crown
From Daath’s pale brows for ever:
Stript of power, no more he reigns;
An empty Shape alone remains;
His sting is lost for ever.
Hallelujah!

It was a strange and dreadful strife,
When Life and Death contended;
The victory remained with Life,
The reign of Death was ended:
Holy Scripture plainly saith,
That Death is swallowed up by Death,
Made henceforth a derision.
Hallelujah!

Here the true Paschal Lamb we see,
Whom God so freely gave us;
He died on the accursed tree
So strong his love! to save us:
See! his blood doth mark our door, 
Faith points to it, Death passes o’er,
The Murd’rer cannot harm us.
Hallelujah!

So let us keep the festival
Where to the Lord invites us;
Christ is himself the joy of all,
The sun that warms and lights us.
By his grace he doth impart 
Eternal sunshine to the heart;
The night of Sin is ended!
Hallelujah!

Then let us feast this Easter day
On the true Bread of heaven;
The Word of grace hath purged away
The old and wicked leaven:
Christ alone our souls will feed,
He is our meat and drink indeed;
Faith lives upon no other.
Hallelujah!
