Te Deum laudamus; paraphrased: Grosser Gott, wir loben dich, Ignaz Franz (1719-1790), c. 1744;
tr. Clarence A. Walworth (1820-1900), 1858

Holy God, we praise thy name!
Lord of all, we bow before thee;
All on earth thy scepter claim,
All in heav’n above adore thee;
Infinite thy vast domain,
Everlasting is thy reign.

Hark! the loud celestial hymn
Angel choirs above are raising;
Cherubim and Seraphim
In unceasing chorus praising,
Fill the heav’ns with sweet accord:
Holy, holy, holy Lord!

Holy Father, Holy Son,
Holy Spirit, Three we name thee,
While in essence only One,
Undivided God we claim thee,
And adoring bend the knee,
While we own the mystery.
