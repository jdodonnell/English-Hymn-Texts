Wilt thou forgive that sin, where I begun,
  Which is my sin, though it were none before?
Wilt thou forgive those sins, through which I run
  And do run still, though still I do deplore?
When thou hast done, thou hast not done,
    For I have more.

Wilt thou forgive that sin, by which I won
  Others to sin, and made my sin their door?
Wilt thou forgive that sin which I did shun
  A year or two, but wallowed in a score?
When thou hast done, thou hast not done,
    For I have more.
    
I have a sin of fear, that when I've spun
  My last thread, I shall perish on the shore;
Swear by thyself, that at my death thy Son
  Shall shine as he shines now, and heretofore.
And having done that, thou hast done--
    I fear no more.
    
 John Donne (1573-1631)
