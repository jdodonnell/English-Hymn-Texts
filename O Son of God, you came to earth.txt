A Patre Unigenite, 10th cent.
Baptism of the Lord. Vespers
tr. St. Cecilia’s Abbey, Hymns for the Liturgy of the Hours, 1979

O Son of God, you came to earth
Through Virgin Mother, full of grace,
And later deigned to be baptized
Your kingdom to inaugurate.

Most High, from heaven you came down,
And chose to share our lowly state,
Your own creation to redeem
And raise to everlasting joy.

Most dear Redeemer, we implore,
In gracious love, come now to us,
And flood our hearts with your pure light
And grace that makes us one with you.

Remain with us, O Lord, we pray,
Remove our heavy clouds of gloom,
Wash all our sinful stains away,
Bestow the healing that we need.

All glory be to you, O Christ,
Who are the Life, the Truth alone;
The Father and the Spirit’s light
On high, revealed you as their own. Amen.
