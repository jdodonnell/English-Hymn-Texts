Gesù sommo conforlo, Girolamo Savonarola, (1452-1498)
tr. Jane Francesca Wilde, (1826-1896), 1853

Jesus, Refuge of the weary,
  Object of the spirit’s love,
Fountain in life’s desert dreary,
  Saviour from the world above;
O how oft Thine eyes, offended,
  Gaze upon the sinner’s fall;
Yet upon the Cross extended,
  Thou didst bear the pain of all.

Do we pass that Cross unheeding,
  Breathing no repentant vow,
Thou we see Thee wounded, bleeding,
  See Thy thorn-encircled brow?
Yet Thy sinless death hath brought us
  Life eternal, peace, and rest;
Only what Thy grace hath taught us
  Calms the sinner’s stormy breast.

Jesus, may our hearts be burning
  With more fervent love for Thee;
May our eyes be ever turning
To Thy Cross of agony;
Till in glory, parted never
  From the blessed Saviour’s side,
Graven in our hearts for ever,
  Dwell the Cross, the Crucified.
