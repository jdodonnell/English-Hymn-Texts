O esca viatorum, 17th cent.;
tr. Athelstan Riley (1958-1945), 1906

O food of men wayfaring,
The Bread of Angels sharing,
O Manna from on high!
We hunger; Lord, supply us,
Nor thy de-lights deny us,
Whose hearts to thee draw nigh.

O Stream of love past telling,
O purest Fountain, welling
From out the Savior’s side!
We faint with thirst; revive us,
Of thine abundance give us,
And all we need provide.

O Jesus, by thee bidden,
We here adore thee, hidden
‘Neath forms of bread and wine.
Grant when the veil is riven,
We may behold, in heaven,
Thy countenance divine.
