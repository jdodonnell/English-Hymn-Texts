William Whiting (1825-1878), 1860

Eternal Father, strong to save,
Whose arm doth bind the restless wave,
Who bidd’st the mighty ocean deep
Its own appointed limits keep;
Oh, hear us when we cry to thee,
For those in peril on the sea!

O Savior, whose almighty Word
The winds and waves submissive heard,
Who walkedst on the foaming deep,
And calm amidst its rage didst sleep;
Oh, hear us when we cry to thee,
For those in peril on the sea!

O sacred Spirit, who didst brood
Upon the chaos dark and rude,
And bad’st its angry tumult cease,
And gavest light and life and peace:
Oh, hear us when we cry to thee,
For those in peril on the sea!

O Trinity of love and pow’r!
Our brethren shield in danger’s hour;
From rock and tempest, fire and foe,
Protect them wheresoe’er they go;
And ever let there rise to thee
Glad hymns of praise from land and sea.
