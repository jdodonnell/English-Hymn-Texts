Schmuecke dich, o liebe Seele, Johann Franck (1618-1677), 1649;
tr. Catherine Winkworth (1827-1878), 1858

Deck thyself, my soul, with gladness,
Leave the gloomy haunts of sadness,
Come into the daylight’s splendor,
There with joy thy praises render
Unto him whose grace unbounded
Hath this wondrous banquet founded,
High o’er all the heav’ns he reigneth,
Yet to dwell with thee he deigneth.

Sun, who all my life dost brighten, 
Light, who dost my soul enlighten,
Joy, the sweetest man e’er knoweth,
Fount, whence all my being floweth,
At thy feet I cry, my Maker,
Let me be a fit partaker
Of this blessed food from heaven,
For our good, thy glory, given.

Jesus, Bread of Life, I pray thee,
Let me gladly here obey thee,
Never to my hurt invited, 
Be thy love with love requited;
From this banquet let me measure,
Lord, how vast and deep its treasure;
Through the gifts thou here dost give me
As thy guest in heav’n receive me.
