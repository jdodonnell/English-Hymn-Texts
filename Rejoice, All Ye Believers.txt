Ermuntert euch, ihr Frommen, Laurentius Laurent, 1660-1722, 1700;
tr. Sarah Borthwick Findlater, 1823-1907, alt. Hymns from the Land of Luther, 1854

Rejoice, all ye believers,
And let your lights appear!
The evening is advancing,
And darker night is near.
The Bride-groom is arising,
And soon He draweth nigh.
Up, watch, and pray, and wrestle,
At midnight comes the cry!

The watchers on the mountain
Proclaim the Bride-groom near;
Go meet Him as He cometh,
With hallelujahs clear.
The marriage feast is waiting,
The gates wide open stand!
Up, up, ye heirs of glory,
The Bride-groom is at hand!

Ye saints, who here in patience
Your cross and suff’rings bore,
Shall live and reign forever,
Where sorrow is no more.
Around the throne of glory
The Lamb ye shall behold,
In triumph cast before Him
Your diadems of gold!

Our hope and expectation,
O Jesus now appear;
Arise, Thou Sun so longed for,
O'er this benighted sphere!
With hearts and hands uplifted,
We plead, O Lord, to see
The day of earth’s redemption,
That brings us unto Thee!
