Joseph Simpson Cook (1859-1933), 1919

Gentle Mary laid her child
Lowly in a manger;
There he lay, the undefiled,
To the world a stranger.
Such a babe in such a place,
Can he be the Savior?
Ask the saved of al the race
Who have found his favor.

Angels sang about his birth;
Wise men sought and found him;
Heavenâ€™s star shone brightly forth,
Glory all around him.
Shepherds saw the wondrous sight,
Heard the angels singing;
All the plains were lit that night,
All the hills were ringing.

Gentle Mary laid her child
Lowly in a manger;
He is still the undefiled,
But no more a stranger.
Son of God, of humble birth,
Beautiful the story;
Praise his Name in all the earth, 
Hail the King of glory!
