Ad cenam Agni providi, 5th cent.
Paschaltide. Vespers
tr. J.M. Neale (1818-1866)

The Lamb’s high banquet we await
In snow-white robes of real state;
And now, the Red Sea’s channel past,
To Christ, our Prince, we sing at last.

Upon the altar of the Cross
His Body hath redeemed our loss;
And tasting of his roseate Blood
Our life is hid with him in God.

That Paschal eve God’s arm was bared; 
The devastating angel spared:
By strength of hand our hosts went free
From Pharaoh’s ruthless tyranny.

Now Christ our Paschal Lamb is slain,
The Lamb of God that knows no stain;
The true Oblation offered here,
Our own unleavened Bread sincere.

O Thou from whom hell’s monarch flies,
O great, O very Sacrifice,
Thy captive people are set free,
And endless life restored in thee.

For Christ, arising from the dead,
From conquered hell victorious sped;
He thrusts the tyrant down to chains,
And Paradise for men regains.

Maker of all, to thee we pray,
Fulfill in us thy joy to day;
When death assails, grant, Lord, that we
May share thy Paschal victory.

To thee, who dead, again dost live,
All glory, Lord, thy people give;
All glory as is ever meet, 
To Father and to Paraclete. Amen.
