At the name of Jesus
  Ev’ry knee shall bow,
Ev’ry tongue confess him
  King of glory now;
’Tis the Father’s pleasure
  We should call him Lord,
Who from the beginning
  Was the mighty word.

At his voice creation
  Sprang at once to sight,
All the Angel faces, 
  All the hosts of light,
Thrones and dominations,
  Stars upon their way,
All the heavenly orders,
  In their great array.

Humbled for a season,
  To receive a name
From the lips of sinners
  Unto whom he came,
Faithfully he bore it
  Spotless to the last,
Brought it back victorious
  When from death he passed.

Bore it up triumphant 
  With its human light,
Through all ranks of creatures,
  To the central height,
To the throne of Godhead,
  To the Father’s breast;
Filled it with the glory
  Of that perfect rest.

Name him, brothers, name him,
  With love as strong as death
But with awe and wonder,
  And with bated breath!
He is God the Savior, 
  He is Christ the Lord,
Ever to be worshipped,
  Trusted and adored.

In your hearts enthrone him;
  There let him subdue
All that is not holy,
  All that is not true;
Crown him as your Captain
  In temptation’s hour;
Let his will enfold you 
  In its light and power.

Brothers, this Lord Jesus
  Shall return again,
With his Father’s glory,
  With his angel train;
For all wreaths of empire
  Meet upon his brow,
And our hearts confess him
  King of glory now.
