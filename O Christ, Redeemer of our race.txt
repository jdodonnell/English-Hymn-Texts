Christe, Redemptor omnium, 6th cent.
Christmas. Vespers
tr. Henry William Baker (1821-1877), Hymnal for the Hours, 2014

O Christ, Redeemer of our race,
Thou brightness of the Father’s face,
Of him, and with him ever One,
Ere times and seasons had begun.

Thou art the very Light of Light,
Unfailing hope in sin’s dark night,
Hear thou the prayers thy people pray
The wide world o’er this blessed day.

Remember, Lord of life and grace,
How once, to save a ruined race,
Thou didst our very flesh assume
In Mary’s undefiled womb.

This day, as year by year its light
Sheds o’er the world a radiance bright,
Tells how, descending from the throne,
Thou savedst man, and thou alone.

The heav'ns above, the rolling main
And all that earth’s wide realms contain,
With joyous voice now loudly sing
The glory of their newborn King.

And we, who by thy Precious Blood
From sin redeemed are marked for God,
On this the day that saw thy birth
Sing the new song of ransomed earth.

All honor, praise, and glory be,
O Jesus, Virgin-born, to thee;
All glory, as is ever meet, 
To Father, and to Paraclete.
