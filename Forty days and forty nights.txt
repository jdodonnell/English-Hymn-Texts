Forty days and forty nights
Thou wast fasting in the wold;
Forty days and forty nights 
Tempted, and yet undefiled:

Sunbeams scorching all the day;
Chilly dewdrops nightly shed;
Prowling beasts about thy way;
Stones thy pillow, earth by bed.

Shall we not thy watchings share,
And from earthly joys abstain,
Fasting with unceasing prayer,
Glad with thee to suffer pain?

And if Satan, vexing sore,
Flesh or spirit should assail,
Thou, his vanquisher before, 
Grant we may not faint or fail.

So shall we have peace divine;
Holier gladness ours shall be;
Round us too shall Angels shine,
Such as ministered to thee.

Keep, O keep us, Savior dear,
Ever constant by thy side;
That with thee we may appear
At the_eternal Eastertide.
