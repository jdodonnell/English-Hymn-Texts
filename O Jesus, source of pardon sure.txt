Sacred Heart. Lauds
St. Cecilia's Abbey

O Jesus, Source of pardon sure,
And hope of all our deepest joy,
You are the fountain of all grace,
And true delight of ev’ry heart.

O Jesus, Hope of sinners all,
How kind you are to those who ask,
How good to those who search for you,
And what indeed to those who find!

Your love it is that feeds our souls,
As gratefully we turn to you,
Repast that pleases ev’ry taste,
And makes us long to love you more.

O Jesus, loved above all else,
True hop of eager heart’s desire:
The soul’s most ardent search for good
Is satisfied by you alone.

Remain with us, beloved Lord,
Be with us like the dawning day,
The shades of night are now dispelled,
Your sweetness fills the world with light.

O Jesus, perfect tenderness,
Surpassing joy of ev’ry heart,
Your goodness is beyond our grasp,
Your love surrounds and holds us fast.

O Jesus, flow’r of Virgin birth,
And sweetest love that man can know,
May ev’ry tongue and nation raise 
To you an endless hymn of praise.
Amen.
