William Chatterton Dix (1837-1898),1861

As with gladness, men of old
Did the guiding star behold,
As with joy they hailed its light, 
Leading onward, beaming bright
So, most glorious Lord, may we
Evermore be led to Thee.

As with joyful steps they sped,
To that lowly manger bed,
There to bend the knee before
Him Whom Heaven and earth adore;
So may we with willing feet
Ever seek thy mercy seat.

AS they offered gifts most rare
At that manger rude and bare;
So may we with holy joy, 
Pure and free form sin’s allow,
All our costliest treasures bring,
Christ, to thee our heav’nly King.

Holy Jesus, ev’ry day
Keep us in the narrow way;
And, when early things are past,
Bring our ransomed souls at last
Where they need no star to guide,
Where no clouds thy glory hide.

In the heav’nly country bright
Need they no created light;
Thou its Light, its Joy, its Crown,
Thou its Sun which goes not down;
There for ever may we sing
Alleluias to our King.
