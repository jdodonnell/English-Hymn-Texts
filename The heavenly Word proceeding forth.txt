Verbum supernum prodiens
Corpus Christi. Lauds
tr. John Chambers

The heav’nly Word proceeding forth, 
Yet leaving not the Father’s side,
And going to his work on earth
Had reached at length life’s eventide.

By false disciple to be giv’n 
To foeman for his Blood athirst,
Himself, the Living Bread from heav’n,
He gave to his disciples first.

To them he gave, in twofold kind,
His very Flesh, his very Blood:
In love’s own fullness thus designed 
Of the whole man to be the food.

By birth, our fellow man was he;
Our meat, while sitting at the board;
He died, our ransomer to be;
He ever reigns, our great reward.

O saving Victim, op’ning wide
The gate of heav’n to man below, 
Our foes press on from ev’ry side,
Thine aid supply, thy strength bestow.

To thy great Name be endless praise, 
Immortal Godhead, One in Three;
O grant us endless length of days
In our true native land, with thee. Amen.
