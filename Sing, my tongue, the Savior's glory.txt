Pange lingua gloriosi
Corpus Christi. Vespers
tr. Edward Caswall

Sing, my tongue, the Savior’s glory, 
Of His Flesh the mystery sing,Of the Blood, all price exceeding, 
Shed by our immortal King, 
Destined, for the world’s redemption, 
From a noble womb to spring.
Of a pure and spotless Virgin, 
Born for us on earth below,He, as man, with man conversing, 
Stayed, the seeds of truth to sow; 
Then he closed in solemn order 
Wondrously his life of woe.
On the night of that Last Supper, 
Seated with his chosen band,He, the Paschal victim eating, 
First fulfills the Law’s command; 
Then as Food to his apostles 
Gives himself with his own hand.

Word-made-Flesh, the bread of nature 
By his word to Flesh he turns;Wine into his Blood he changes— 
What though sense no change discerns? 
Only be the heart in earnest,Faith her lesson quickly learns.
Down in adoration falling,Lo! the sacred Host we hail;Lo! o’er ancient forms departing, 
Newer rites of grace prevail; 
Faith for all defects supplying, 
Where the feeble senses fail.
6. To the everlasting Father,And the Son who reigns on high, 
With the Holy Ghost proceeding 
Forth from Each eternally,Be salvation, honor, blessing, 
Might, and endless majesty. Amen.
