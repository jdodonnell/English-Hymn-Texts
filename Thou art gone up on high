Thou art gone up on high
  To mansions in the skies,
And round thy throne unceasingly
  The songs of praise arise.
But we are lingering here,
  With sin and care oppressed;
Lord, send thy promised Comforter,
  And lead us to our rest.

Thou art gone up on high;
  But thou didst first come down,
Through earth's most bitter misery
  To pass unto thy crown;
And girt with griefs and fears
  Our onward course must be;
But only let that path of tears
  Lead us at last to thee!

Thou art gone up on high;
  But thou shalt come again
With all the bright ones of the sky
  Attendant in thy train.
O by thy saving power
  So make us live and die,
That we may stand, in that dread hour,
  At thy right hand on high.

Emma Leslie Toke (1812-1878), 1851
