Chorus novae Ierusalem
Paschaltide. Lauds
Robert Campbell

Ye choirs of new Jerusalem,
To sweet new strains attune your theme;
The while we keep, from care released,
With solemn joy, our Paschal feast.

When Christ, unconquered Lion, first
The dragon’s chains by rising burst:
And while with living voice he cries,
The dead of other ages rise.

Engorged in former years, their prey
Must death and hell restore today:
And many a captive soul set free,
With Jesus leaves captivity.

Right gloriously he triumphs now,
Worthy to whom should all things bow;
And joining heav’n and earth again,
Links in one commonweal the twain.

And we, as these his deeds we sing,
His suppliant soldiers, pray our King,
That in his palace, bright and vast,
We may keep watch and ward at last.

Maker of all, to thee we pray;
Fulfill in us thy joy today;
When death assails, grant, Lord, that we
May share thy Paschal victory.

To thee, once dead, who now dost live,
All glory, Lord, thy people give,
Whom, with the Father we adore,
And Holy Ghost for evermore. Amen.
