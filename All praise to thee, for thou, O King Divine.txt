All praise to thee, for thou, O King divine,
Did yield the glory that of right was thine,
That in our darkened hearts thy grace might shine.
Alleluia!

Thou came to us in lowliness of thought;
By thee the outcast and the poor were sought,
And by thy death was God’s salvation wrought.
Alleluia!

Let this mind be in us which was in thee,
Who was a servant that we might be free,
Humbling thyself to death on Calvary.
Alleluia!

Wherefore, by God’s eternal purpose, thou
Art high exalted o’er all creatures now,
And giv’n the Name to which all knees shall bow.
Alleluia!

Let every tongue confess with one accord
In heav’n and earth that Jesus Christ is Lord;
And God the Father be by all adored.
Alleluia!
