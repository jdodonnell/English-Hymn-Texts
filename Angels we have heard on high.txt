Les Anges Dans Nos Campagnes, French carol; tr. James Chadwick (1813-1882), adapt. Henri Hemy (1818-1888), 1862; alt. traditional

Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing o’er the plains,
And the mountains in reply
Echo back their joyous strains.

Glória in excélsis Deo!
Glória in excélsis Deo!

Shepherds, why this jubilee? Why your joyous strains prolong?
What the gladsome tidings be
Which inspire your heav’nly song?

Come to Bethlehem and see
Christ Whose birth the angels sing;
Come, adore on bended knee,
Christ the Lord, the newborn King.

See Him in a manger laid, 
Whom the choirs of angels praise;
Mary, Joseph, lend your aid, 
While our hearts in love we raise.



H. Hemy, unaltered:

Angels we have heard on high,
Sweetly singing o’er the plains,
And the mountains in reply,
Echo still their joyous strains.
	Gloria in excelsis Deo.


Shepherds, why this jubilee? 
Why your rapturous strain prolong?
Say what may the tidings be,
Which inspire your heav’nly song?
	Glória in excélsis Deo.

Come to Bethlehem, come and see
Him whose birth the angels sing;
Come, adore on bended knee,
The Infant Christ, the newborn King.
	Gloria in excelsis Deo.

See within a manger laid, 
Jesus, Lord of heaven and earth!
Mary, Joseph, lend your aid, 
To celebrate our Saviour’s birth.
	Gloria in excelsis Deo.
