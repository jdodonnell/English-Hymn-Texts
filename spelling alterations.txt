Only a few changes have been made from the original texts. These are as follows:

- Spelling has been changed to conform with American and or Latin church custom. Thus, “Alleluya” has become “Alleluia;” “splendour” has been changed to “splendor;” 

- The ending “-ed” is marked with an accent mark (”-èd”) when the poetic meter requires its pronunciation. If not marked, it is not to be pronounced as a separate syllable.

- “defense” rather than the British, “defence”
