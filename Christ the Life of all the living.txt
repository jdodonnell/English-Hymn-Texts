Jesu, meines Lebens Leben, Ernst Christopher Homburg (1605-1681), 1659
tr. Catherine Winkworth (1829-1878), 1863

Christ the Life of all the living,
  Christ he Death of death, our foe,
Who Thyself for us once giving
  To the darkest depths of woe,
Patiently didst yield thy breath
But to save my soul from death;
Thousand, thousand thanks shall be,
Blessed Jesus, unto thee.

Thou, ah thou, hast taken on thee
  Bitter strokes, a cruel rod;
Pain and scorn were heaped upon thee,
  O thou sinless Son of God,
Only thus for me to win
Rescue from the bonds of sin;
Thousand, thousand thanks shall be,
Blessèd Jesus, unto thee.

Thou didst bear the smiting only
  That it might not fall on me;
Stouts falsely charged and lonely, 
  That I might be safe and free;
Comfortless that I might know
Comfort from thy boundless woe.
Thousand, thousand thanks shall be,
Blessèd Jesus, unto thee.

Then for all that wrought our pardon,
  For thy sorrows deep and sore,
For thine anguish in the darden,
  I will thank thee evermore;
Thank thee with my latest breath
For thy sad and cruel death,
For that last and bitter cry
Praise thee evermore on high.
