Richard Frederick Littledale (1833-1890)

Arise, O Ark of Christ the Lord, 
To thy celestial station,
While Angel hosts with glad accord 
Sing our their acclamation;
Above the Seraphs take thy stand
Henceforth from sorrow resting,
All glorious at the King’s right hand
In gold and bordered vesting.

O Lily of th eValleys fair,
O sealed and crystal Fountain,
Thy place is nearest to him there
Upon his Holy mountain;
The saints and angels see his face
All bowed in adoration,
Thou, Mary, gazes, full of grace,
With Mother’s exultation.

He came to thee, a Babe alone,
From all his pomp descending:
Thou camest, radiant to his Throne,
With virgin choirs attending.
One poorest of all earth hath seen,
God’s handmaid, meek and lowly,
Now thou art crowned of Heaven the Queen,
And foremost of the lowly.

That crown with twelve pure stars bedight,
In ray around is shedding,
The sun hath made thy raiment bright,
Thy feet the moon are treading;
Yet, as of old, at Nazareth, 
Beside his cradle kneeling,
And later, at the cross of death,
Thy soul to anguish steeling.

Though robed and crowned, thou lowly art,
O stainless Mother-maiden,
And feeblest for each human heart
With sin and sorrow laden;
Then to thy Son for sinners pray 
As Mother interceding,
As on, He will not say thee nay,
But grant thee all thy pleading.

Arise O Ark of Christ the Lord,
To thy celestial station,
While angel hosts with glad accord 
Sing our their acclamation.
To God the Father praise be done,
Who gave thee grace and merit;
Praise be to Christ, thine Only Son,
And to thy Spouse, the  Spirit.
