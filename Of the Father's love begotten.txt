Corde natus ex Parentis, Marcus Aurelius Clemens Prudentius (348-413)
Solemnity of Mary, the Mother of God. Vespers
tr. J.M. Neale

Of the Father’s love begotten
Ere the worlds began to be,
He is Alpha and Omega,
He the source, the ending he,
Of the things that are, that have been,
And that future years shall see,
Evermore and evermore.

O that birth for ever blessed!
When the Virgin, full of grace,
By the Holy Ghost conceiving
Bare the Savior of our race,
And the Babe, the world’s Redeemer,
First revealed his sacred face,
Evermore and evermore.

This is he who Seers in old time
Chanted of with one accord;
Whom the voices of the prophets
Promised in their faithful word;
Now he shines, the long-expected:
Let creation praise its Lord,
Evermore and evermore.

O ye heights of heav’n adore him;
Angel hosts, his praises sing;
Pow’rs, dominions, bow before him,
And extol our God and King:
Let no tongue on earth be silent,
Every voice in concert ring,
Evermore and Evermore.

Christ, to thee with God the Father,
And, O Holy Ghost, to thee,
Hymn and chant and high thanksgiving,
And unwearied praises be,
Honor, glory, and dominion,
And eternal victory,
Evermore and evermore. Amen.
