Christ, the glory of the sky;
Christ, of earth the hope secure;
Only Son of God most high;
Offspring of a maiden pure!

Purest Light, within us dwell, 
Never from our souls depart;
Come, the shades of earth expel,
Fill and purify the heart.

Help us now Thy praise to sing
Praise for this returning day;
Light and life let morning bring,
Clouds and darkness flee away!

Faith in Him, Whose name we bear,
In our heart of hearts abound!
Hope, thy brightest torch prepare;
All with holy love be crowned!

Praise the Father; praise the Son,
Spirit blest, to Thee be praise!
To the eternal Three in One
Glory be through endless days!
