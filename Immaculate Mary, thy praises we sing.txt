Immaculate Mary, thy praises we sing,
Who reignest in splendor with Jesus our King.

Ave Maria.

In heaven, the bless√®d thy glory proclaim;
On earth, we thy children invoke thy fair name.

Thy name is our power, thy virtues our light,
Thy love is our comfort, thy pleading our might.

We pray for our mother, the Church upon earth;
And bless, dearest Lady, the land of our birth.
