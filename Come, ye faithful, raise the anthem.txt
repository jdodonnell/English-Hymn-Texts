Job Hupton (1762-1849), 1805; re-written by John Mason Neale (1818-1866), 1867

Come, ye faithful, raise the anthem, 
Cleave the skies with shouts of praise;
Sing to him who found the ransom,
Ancient of eternal days,
God eternal, Word in carnate,
Whom the heav’n of heav’n obeys.

Ere he raised the lofty mountains, 
Formed the sea, or built the sky,
Love eternal, free, and boundless,
Forced the Lord of life to die,
Lifted up the Prince of princes 
On the throne of Calvary.

Now on those eternal mountains,
Stands the sapphire throne, all bright,
With the ceaseless alleluias
Which they which they raise, the sons of light;
Sion’s people tell his praises,
Victor after hard-won fight.

Bring your harps, and bring you incense,
Sweep the string and pour the lay;
Let the earth proclaim his wonders,
King of that celestial day;
He the Lamb once slain is worthy,
Who was dead, and lives for ay.

Laud and honor to the Father, 
Laud and honor to the Son,
Laud and honor to the Spirit,
Ever Three and ever One,
Consubstantial, coeternal, 
While unending ages run.
