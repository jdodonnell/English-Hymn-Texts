Christus ist erstanden, Michael Weisse (c. 1488-1534), 1531; tr. Catherine Winkworth (1829-1878), 1858

Christ the Lord is ris’n again;
Christ hath broken ev’ry chain
Hark! angelic voices cry,
Singing evermore on high, 
Alleluia!

He who gave for us his life,
Who for us endured the strife,
Is our Paschal Lamb today; 
We too sing for joy, and say: 
Alleluia!
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!
Hark, angelic voices cry,
Singing evermore on high, 
Alleluia!

He who bore all pain and loss
Comfortless upon the Cross,
Lives in glory now on high,
Pleads for us, and hears our cry:
Alleluia!

He who slumbered in the grave,
Is exalted now to save;
Through the universe it rings
That the Lamb is King of kings,
Alleluia!
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!
Hark, angelic voices cry,
Singing evermore on high, 
Alleluia!

Now he bids us tell abroad, 
How the lost may be restored,
How the penitent forgiv’n, 
How we too may enter heav’n.
Alleluia!

Thou, our Paschal Lamb indeed,
Christ, thy ransomed people feed;
Take our sins and guilt away,
That we all may sing for aye:
Alleluia!
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!
Hark, angelic voices cry,
Singing evermore on high, 
Alleluia!
Amen.
