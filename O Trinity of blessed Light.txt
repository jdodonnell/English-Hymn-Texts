O Lux, beata Trinitas
Trinity Sunday. Vespers
John Mason Neale

O Trinity of blessed Light,
O Unity of princely might,
The fiery sun now goes his way;
Shed thou within our hearts thy ray.

To thee our morning song of praise,
To thee our evening prayer we raise;
Thy glory suppliant we adore
For ever and for evermore.

All laud to God the Father be;
All praise, eternal Son, to thee;
All glory as is ever meet,
To God the holy Paraclete. Amen.
