Ye holy angels bright, 
  Who wait at God's right hand,
Or through the realms of light
  Fly at your Lord's command,
    Assist our song,
      For else the theme 
      Too high doth seem
    For mortal tongue.
    
Ye blessed souls at rest,
  Who ran this earthly race,
And now, from sin released,
  Behold the Savior's face,
    God's praises sound,
      As in his sight
      With sweet delight
    Ye do abound.
    
Ye saints, who toil below,
  Adore your heav'nly King,
And onward as ye go
  Some joyful anthem sing;
    Take what the gives
      And praise him still,
      Through good or ill,
    Who ever lives!
    
My soul, bear thou thy part,
  Triumph in God above:
And with a well-tuned heart
  Sing thou the songs of love!
    Let all thy days
      Till life shall end,
      Whate'er he send,
    Be filled with praise.
    
Richard Baxter (1615-91) and others
