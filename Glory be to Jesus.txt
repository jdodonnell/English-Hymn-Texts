Viva, Viva Jesu, Italian, c. 18th cent.;
tr. Edward Caswall (1814-1878), 1857

Glory be to Jesus, 
Who in bitter pains
Poured for me the life-blood
From his sacred veins!

Grace and life eternal
In that blood I find,
Blest be his compassion,
Infinitely kind!

Blest through endless ages
Be the precious stream,
Which from endless torments
Does the world redeem!

Abelâ€™s blood for vengeance
Pleaded to the skies;
But the Blood of Jesus
For our pardon cries.

Oft as earth exulting
Wafts its praise on high,
Angel-hosts, rejoicing
Make their glad reply.

Lift ye then your voices;
Swell the mighty flood;
Louder still and louder,
Praise the precious Blood!
