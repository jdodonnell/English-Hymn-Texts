Traditional English carol

God rest you merry, gentlemen,
Let nothing you dismay.
For Jesus Christ our Savior, 
Was born on Christmas Day;
To save us all from Satan’s power,
When we were gone astray.

O tidings of comfort and joy.

In Bethlehem, in Jewry,
This blessèd Babe was born,
And laid within a manger,
Upon this blessèd morn;
the which his mother Mary 
Did nothing take in scorn.

From God our heavenly Father,
A blessèd angel came.
And unto certain shepherds,
Brought tidings of the same,
How that in Bethlehem was born,
The Son of God by name:

Fear not, then said the Angel,
Let nothing you affright,
This day is born a Savior, 
Of virtue, power, and might;
So frequently to vanquish all,
The friends of Satan quite;

The shepherds at those tidings,
Rejoiced much in mind,
And left their flocks a feeding,
In tempest, storm, and wind,
And went to Bethlehem straightway,
This blessèd babe to find.

But when in Bethlehem they came,
Whereas this infant lay
They found him in a manger,
Where oxen feed on hay;
His mother Mary kneeling,
Unto the Lord did pray:
