The Lord ascendeth up on high,
  Loud anthems round him swelling;
The Lord hath triumphed gloriously,
  In power and might excelling:
Hell and the grave are captive led;
Lo, he returns, our glorious Head,
  To his eternal dwelling.
  
The heav'ns with joy receive their Lord;
  O day of exultation!
By saints, by angel-hosts adored
  For his so great salvation:
O earth, adore thy glorious King,
His rising, his ascension sing
  With grateful adoration.
  
By saints in earth and saints in heav'n,
  With songs for ever blended,
All praise to Christ our King be giv'n,
  Who hath to heav'n ascended:
To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
The God of heav'n's resplendent host,
  In bright array extended.
