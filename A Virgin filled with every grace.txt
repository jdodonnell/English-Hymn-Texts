Fit porta Christi pervia, 
Solemnity of Mary, the Mother of God. Lauds
tr. St. Cecilia’s Abbey, Hymns for the Liturgy of the Hours, 1979

A Virgin filled with ev’ry grace
Was chosen as Christ’s holy gate,
The passing of the King preserved 
Her purity for evermore.

For God the Son in course of time
Came forth from spotless Virgin’s womb,
Creator, Bridegroom of the soul,
The Giant to redeem his Church.

His Mother’s glory and her joy,
He is our hope which cannot fail;
The stone from mystic mountain-side,
To fill the world with life and grace.

Let every soul exult and sing,
For now the nation’s Savior comes,
The Lord of all the world is here
To ransom those whom he has made.

All praise and glory be to Christ,
Begotten of the Father’s love,
Whom Virgin Mother once brought forth,
Made fruitful by the Spirit’s pow’r. Amen.
