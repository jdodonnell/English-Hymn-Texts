Iam, Christe, sol iustitiae
Lent. Lauds
tr. John Dryden

Now Christ, thou Sun of Righteousness,
Let dawn our darkened spirits bless:
The light of grace to us restore
While day to earth returns once more.

Now days of grace with mercy flow,
O Lord, the gift of tears bestow,
To wash our stains in every part,
Whilst heavâ€™nly fire consumes the heart.

Rise, crystal tears, form that same source
From whence our sins derive their course,
Nor cease, till hardened hearts relent,
And, softened by they streams, repent.

Behold, the happy days return,
The days of joy for them that mourn;
May we of their indulgence share,
And bless the God who grabs our prayer.

Let all the world form shore to shore
Thee, gracious Trinity, adore;
Right soon thy loving pardon grant,
That we our new-made song may chant.
