Thomas Kelly (1769-1855), 1809

Look, ye saints, the sight is glorious;
See the Man of Sorrows now!
From the fight returned victorious,
Ev’ry knee to him shall bow.
Crown him!
Crowns become the victor’s brow.

Crown the Savior! Angels, crown him;
Rich the trophies Jesus brings;
On the seat of pow’r enthrone him
While the vault of heaven rings.
Crown him!
Crown the Savior King of kings.

Sinners in derision crowned him
Mocking thus the Savior’s claim;
Saints and angels crowd around him,
Own his title,
praise his Name:
Crown him!
Spread abroad the victor’s fame.

Hark, those bursts of acclamation!
Harkus takes the highest station;
Oh, what joy the sight affords!
Crown him!
King of kings, and Lord of lords!
