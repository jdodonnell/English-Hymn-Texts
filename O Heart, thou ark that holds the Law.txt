Cor, arca legem continens
Sacred Heart. Office of Readings
Â© St. Meinrads

O Heart, thou ark that holds the Law,
But not of slavery;
The Law of pardon, mercy, grace
Made known to all by thee.

O Heart, thou sanctuary pure
Of the new Law of grace;
The temple old, with its rent veil
Must now to thee give place.

Thy love has willed that thou be pierced,
Thy heart be opened wide,
That we might see and venerate
The love concealed inside.

Beneath this symbol of his Love,
In bloody, mystic wise,
As priest Christ suffered, offered up
A double sacrifice.

Who would not love one loving him,
Who bought him back by grace,
And choose within his Sacred Heart
A lasting dwelling place?

All praise to thee, O Lord, whose Heart
Of grace is a rich store,
To Father and to Comforter 
Now and forevermore. 
Amen.
