Allein Gott in der Höh sei Ehr, N. Decius, 1525; tr. C. Winkworth, 1863, alt.

All glory be to God on high,
Who hath our race befriended!
To us no harm shall now come nigh,
The strife at last is ended;
God showeth His goodwill to men,
And peace shall reign on earth again;
O thank Him for His goodness!

We praise, we worship Thee, we trust
And give Thee thanks forever,
O Father, that Thy rule is just
And wise, and changes never;
Thy boundless grace o’er all things reigns,
Thou dost whate’er Thy will ordains;
’Tis well Thou art our Ruler!

O Jesus Christ, our God and Lord,
Begotten of the Father,
O Thou who hast our peace restored,
And the lost sheep dost gather,
Thou Lamb of God, enthroned on high
Behold our need and hear our cry;
Have mercy on us, Jesus!

O Holy Spirit, precious Gift,
Thou Comforter unfailing,
Do Thou our troubled souls uplift,
Against the foe prevailing;
Avert our woes and calm our dread:
For us the Savior’s blood was shed;
Do Thou in faith sustain us!
