Macht hoch die Th√ºr, Georg Weissel, 1590-1635, 1642 ; tr. Catherine Winkworth, 1855, alt.
%% Common Service Book of the Lutheran Church, 1917

Lift up your heads, ye mighty gates!
Behold the King of Glory waits;
The King of kings is drawing hear, 
The Savior of the world is here;
Life and salvation He doth bring,
Wherefore rejoice, and gladly sing:
  We praise Thee, Father, now,
  Creator, wise art Thou!

The Lord is just, a Helper tried,
Mercy is ever at His side;
His kingly crown is holiness,
His scepter, pity in distress,
The end of all our woe He brings;
Wherefore the earth is glad and sings:
  We praise Thee, Savior now,
  Mighty in deed art Thou!

O blest the land, the city blest,
Where Christ the Ruler is confest!
O happy hearts and happy homes
to whom this King in triumph comes!
The cloudless Sun of joy He is,
Who bright pure delight and bliss:
  O Comforter Divine,
  What boundless grace is Thine!

Redeemer, come! I open wide
My heart to Thee; here, Lord, abide!
Let me Thy inner presence know,
Thy grace and love on me bestow;
Thy Holy Spirit guide us on,
Until our glorious goal be won!
  Eternal praise and fame
  We offer to Thy name.
