Trinitas, summo solio coruscans
Trinity Sunday. Lauds
tr. St Ceciliaâ€™s Abbey

Most holy Trinity, One God,
Enthroned in splendor and in light,
Your love holds every human heart,
Unending praise is but your due.

O Father, Essence of all life,
Bestowing it upon mankind,
Help us by faith your gifts to win,
Your image meriting to bear.

Clear brightness of Eternal Light, 
O God the Son, who shared our state,
Make us true branches of your Vine
That strive to yield abundant fruit.

O Holy Spirit, Fire of Love, 
Whose gentle force directs the world,
Renew our minds at dawn of day,
And prompt our wills to do your work.

O Trinity, delightful Guest,
Abide with us in closest bond,
Until we sing to you above,
In gratitude and joy untold. Amen.
