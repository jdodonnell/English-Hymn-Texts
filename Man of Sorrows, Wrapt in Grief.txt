Matthew Bridges (1800-1894)

Man of Sorrows, wrapt in grief, 
Bow Thine ear to our relief;
Thou for us the pat hast trod
Of the dreadful wrath of God;
Thou the cup of fire hast drained
Till its light alone remained.
Lamb of Love! we look to Thee:
Hear our mournful litany.

By the garden, fraught with woe,
Wither Thou full oft wouldst go;
By Thine agony of prayer
In the desolation there;
By the dire and deep distress
Of that myst’ry fathomless:
Lord, our tears in mercy see:
Hearken to our litany.

By the chalice brimming o’er 
ith disgrace and torment sore;
By those lips which fain would pray
That it might but pass away;
By the heart which drank it dry,
Lest a rebel race should die–
Be Thy pity, Lord, our plea:
Hear our solemn litany.

Man of Sorrows! let Thy grief
Purchase for us our relief;
Lord of mercy! bow Thine ear,
Slow to anger, swift to hear;
By the Cross’s royal road
Lead us to the throne of God,
There for aye to sing to Thee
Heaven’s triumphant litany.
