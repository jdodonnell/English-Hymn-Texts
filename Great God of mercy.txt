Great God of mercy, God of consolation,
Look on your people, gathered here to praise you:
Pity our weakness, come in pow’r to aid us,
Source of all blessing.

Jesus Redeemer, Lord of all creation,
Come as our Savior, Jesus friend of sinners:
Grant us forgiveness, lift our downcast spirit,
Heal us and save us.

Joygiving Spirit, be our light in darkness,
Come to befriend us, help us bear our burdens:
Give us true courage, breathe your peace around us, 
Stay with us always.

God in three persons, Trinity eternal, 
Come to renew us, fill your Church with glory:
Grant us your healing, pledge of resurrection,
Foretaste of heaven.
