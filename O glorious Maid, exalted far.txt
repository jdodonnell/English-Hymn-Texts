O gloriosa Femina, Venantius Fortunatus (c.530-c.600);
tr. Percy Dearmer (1867-1936), 1906

O glorious Maid, exalted far
Beyond the light of burning star,
From him who made thee thou has won
Grace to be Mother of his Son.

That which was lost in hapless Eve
Thy holy Scion did retrieve:
The tear-worn sons of Adam’s race
Through thee have seen the heav’nly place.

Thou wast the gate of heav’n’s high Lord,
The door through which the light hath poured.
Christians rejoice, for though a Maid
To all mankind is life conveyed.

All honor, laud, and glory be,
O Jesus, Virgin-born, to thee!
All glory, as is ever meet,
To Father and to Paraclete.
