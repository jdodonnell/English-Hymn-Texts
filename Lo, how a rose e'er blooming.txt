Lo, how a rise e’er blooming, 
From tender stem hath sprung!
From Jesse’s lineage coming,
As men of old have sung.
It came, a flow’ret bright,
Amid the cold of winter
When half spent was the night.

Isaiah ’twas foretold it,
The Rose I have in mind
With Mary we behold it,
The Virgin mother kind.
To show God’s love aright,
She bore to men a Savior
When half spent was the night.

The shepherds heard the story
Proclaimed by angels bright,
How Christ, the Lord of Glory
Was born on earth this night.
To Bethlehem they sped
And in the manger found him,
As angel heralds said.

This Flow’r, whose fragrance tender
With sweetness fills the air,
Dispels with glorious splendor
The darkness ev’rywhere;
True man, yet very God,
From Sin and death he saves us,
And lightens ev’ry load.
