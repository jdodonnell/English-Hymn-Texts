Wie schön leuchtet der Morgenstern, Philipp Nicolai (1556-1608), 1599;
freely tr. W Mercer (1811-1873), 1859

How bright appears the Morning Star,
With mercy beaming from afar;
The host of heav’n rejoices;
O Righteous Branch, O Jesse’s Rod!
Thou Son of man and Son of God!
We, too, will lift our voices:
Jesus, Jesus! 
Holy, Holy, yet most lowly, Draw thou near us;
Great Emmanuel, come and hear us.

Though circled by the hosts on high, 
He deigned to cast a pitying eye
Upon his helpless creature;
The whole creation’s Head and Lord,
By highest seraphim adored,
Assumed our very nature;
Jesus, grant us, 
Through Thy merit, to inherit
Thy salvation;
Hear, O hear our supplication.

Rejoice, ye heav’ns; thou earth, reply;
With praise, ye sinners, fill the sky,
For this his incarnation.
Incarnate God, put forth thy pow’r,
Ride on, ride on, great Conquerer,
Till all know thy salvation.
Amen, Amen!
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Praise be given
Evermore, by earth and heaven.
