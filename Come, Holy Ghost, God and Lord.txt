Komm, Heiliger Geist, Herre Gott, Martin Luther (1483-1546), 1524; tr. Catherine Winkworth and others

Come Holy Ghost, God and Lord!
Be all thy graces now outpoured
On each believer’s mind and heart;
Thy fervent love to them impart.
Lord by the brightness of thy light 
Thou in the faith dost men unite
Of ev’ry land and ev’ry tongue;
This to thy praise, O Lord, our God, be sung.
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

Thou holy Light, Guide divine,
Oh, cause the Word of Life to shine!
Teach us to know our God aright
And call him Father with delight.
From ev’ry error keep us free;
Let none but Christ our Master be
That we in living faith abide,
In Him, our Lord, with all our might confide.
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

Thou holy Fire, Comfort true,
Grant us the will thy work to do
And in thy service to abide;
Let trials turn us not aside.
Lord, by thy power prepare each heart
And to our weakness strength impart
That bravely here we may contend,
Through life and death to thee, our Lord, ascend.
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
