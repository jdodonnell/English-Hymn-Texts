vs. 1-4, The English Catholic Hymn Book (W. Knott & Sons, Revised and augmented edition 1955); vs. 5, John Mason Neale

Holy Michael, great Archangel,
Nerve thine arm and bare thy sword,
Lead us with thy dazzling legions,
In the battle for the Lord:
Sure defense and trusty safeguard,
Let thy mighty strength afford.

Not with flesh and blood we wrestle,
Not as man with man contend,
But against the powers of darkness,
Who on craft and lies depend:
Treachery and shame and violence,
All the cause of Hell befriend.

Through God’s threefold fair creation,
Through the earth, the sea, the sky,
Wander Satan's loathly spirits,
Luring souls of men to die:
Cast them down, O Prince of Angels,
By the power of God most high.

All who pouring out their life blood,
More than conquer in the fight,
All who in th’ unequal combat,
Fall beneath the oppressor's might:
Christ the King’s great Standard-Bearer,
Lead into the Holy Light!

Laud and honor to the Father,
Laud and honor to the Son,
Laud and honor to the Spirit,
Ever Three, and ever One;
Consubstantial, co-eternal,
While unending ages run.
