Immensa et una, Trinitas
Trinity Sunday. Vespers
St. Ceciliaâ€™s Abbey

Almighty Trinity in One,
Whose sov'reign pow'r all things has made,
You rule the ages and the world,
Before all time You reigned supreme.

Full plenitude of joy is yours,
Alone and perfect, needing naught,
Unsullied, Simple, Purity,
All things are held within you sway.

O Father, fount of every grace,
O Father's glory, God the Son,
O Holy Spirit of them both,
Unending source of love divine.

To you, the Origin serene,
The Godhead one in Persons three,
All things created owe their form
And every beauty they contain.

Your children whom you have endowed
With sonship and adoption's gift,
Beg you to make them temples fair
For your indwelling Spirit's joy.

O living Light, grant us the grace
To join the angels round our throne,
That praising you with grateful love,
Creation's hymn may never end. Amen.
