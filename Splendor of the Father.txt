Splendor of the Father, 
Jesus Christ our Savior,
Mary Virgin Mother, 
Joseph their protector.

Family most holy
Pattern of all virtues,
Shed those graces on us
Which adorned your homestead.

Angels bow in wonder
Son of God perceiving
In our human nature
Subject to his servants.

Humble leader Joseph, 
Held a father’s office,
Teacher of the Christ-Child,
Serving him and Mary.

This most loving cottage
Court of kings surpasses,
Therein flow’rd salvation
For all men and nations.

Jesus, Mary, Joseph,
Grant to us the virtues
Which make home-life happy,
Following your model.

Praise to you, Christ Jesus,
Who with hope inspire us
Of attaining heaven,
Aided by your parents.
