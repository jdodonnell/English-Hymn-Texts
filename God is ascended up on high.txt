Gen himmel aufgefahren ist
tr. Henry More (1614-1687)

God is ascended up on high,
Alleluia
With merry noise of trumpet's sound,
Alleluia
And princely seated in the sky,
Alleluia
Rules over all the world around.
Alleluia

In human shape and flesh He went,
Adorned with His passion's scars,
Which in heaven's sight He did present
More glorious than the glittering stars.

Lord, raise our sinking minds therefore
Up to our proper country dear,
And purify us evermore,
To fit us for those regions clear.
