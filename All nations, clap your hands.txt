Psalm 47, anon.; The Psalter, 1912

All nations, clap your hands,
Let shouts of triumph ring,
For mighty over all the lands
The Lord Most High is King.

Above our mighty foes
He gave us power to stand,
And as our heritage He chose
The goodly promised land.

With shouts ascends our King,
With trumpet's stirring call;
Praise God, praise God, His praises sing,
For God is Lord of all.

O sing in joyful strains,
And make His glory known;
God over all the nations reigns,
And holy is His throne.

Our fathers' God to own
The kings of earth draw night,
For none can save but God alone,
He is the Lord Most High.
