Beata nobis gaudia
Pentecost. Lauds
tr. John Mason Neale

Rejoice! The year upon its way
Has brought again that blessed day,
When on the chosen of the Lord
The Holy Spirit was outpoured.

On each the fire, descending stood
In quiv’ring tongues similitude–
Tongues, that their words might ready prove,
And fire, to make them flame with love.

To all in ev’ry tongue they spoke;
Amazement in the crowd awoke,
Who mocked, as overcome with wine,
Those who were filled with pow’r divine.

These things were done in type that day,
When Eastertide had passed away,
The number told which once set free
The captive at the jubilee.

And now, O holy God, this day
Regard us as we humbly pray,
And send us, from thy heav’nly seat,
The blessings of the Paraclete.

To God the Father, God the Son,
And God the Spirit, praise be done;
May Christ eh Lord upon us pour 
The Spirit’s gift for evermore. Amen.
