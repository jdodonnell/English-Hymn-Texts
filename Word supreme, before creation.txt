John Keble (1792-1866)

Word supreme, before creation
  Born of God eternally
Who didst will for our salvation
  To be born on earth, and die;
Well thy saints have kept their station,
  Watching till thine hour drew nigh.

Now ’tis come, and faith espies thee:
  Like an eagle in the morn,
John in steadfast worship eyes thee,
  Thy belov’d, thy latest born:
In thy glory he descries thee
  Reigning from the tree of scorn.

He first hoping and believing
  Did beside the grave adore;
Latest he, the warfare leaving,
  Landed on the eternal shore;
And his witness we receiving
  Own thee Lord for evermore.

Much he asked in loving wonder,
  On thy bosom leaning, Lord!
In that secret place of thunder,
  Answer kind didst thou accord,
Wisdom for thy Church to ponder
  Till the day of dread award.

Thee, the Almighty King eternal,
  Father of the eternal Word;
Thee, the Father’s Word supernal,
  Thee, of both, the Breath adored;
Heaven, and earth, and realms infernal
  Own, one glorious God and Lord. Amen.
