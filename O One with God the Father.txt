William W. How, (1823-1897)

O One with God the Father,
In majesty and might,
The brightness of his glory,
Eternal Light of light,
O’er this our home of darkness
Thy rays are streaming now;
The shadows flee before thee,
The world’s true Light art thou.

Yet, Lord, we see but darkly,
O heavenly Light, arise,
Dispel these mists that shroud us,
And hide thee from our eyes.
We long to track the footprints
That thou thyself hast trod;
We long to see the pathway
That leads to thee our God.

O Jesus, shine around us,
With radiance of thy grace;
O Jesus, turn upon us
The brightness of thy face.
We need no star to guide us,
As on our way we press,
If thou thy light vouchsafest,
O Sun of Righteousness.
