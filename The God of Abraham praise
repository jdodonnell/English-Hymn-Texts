  The God of Abraham praise
  Who reigns enthroned above,
Ancient of everlasting days,
    And God of love:
  To him uplift your voice,
  At whose supreme command
From earth we rise to seek the joys
    At his right hand.
    
  Though nature's strength decay,
  And earth and hell withstand,
To Canaan's bounds we urge our way
    At his command.
  The watery deep we pass,
  With Jesus in our view,
And through the howling wilderness
    Our way pursue.
    
  The goodly land we see,
  With peace and plenty blest,
A land of sacred liberty
    And endless rest;
  There milk and honey flow,
  And oil and wine abound,
And trees of life for ever grow
    With mercy crowned.
    
  There dwells the Lord our King,
  The Lord our Righteousness,
Triumphant o'er the world and sin,
    The Prince of Peace:
  On Sion's sacred height
  His kingdom he maintains,
And glorious with his saints in light
    For ever reigns.

  Before the Savior's face
  The ransomed nations bow,
O'erwhelmed at his almighty grace
    For ever new:
  He shows the prints of love-
  They kindle to a flame,
And sound through all the worlds above
    The slaughtered Lamb.
    
  Before the great Thee-One
  They all exulting stand,
And tell the wonders he has done 
    Throughout the land:
  The listening spheres attend,
  And swell the growing fame,
And sing in songs which never end
    The wondrous name.
  
  The God who reigns on high
  The great archangels sing,
And 'Holy, holy, holy' cry
    'Almighty King!'
  Who was, and is the same,
  And evermore shall be:
Eternal Father, great I AM,
    We worship thee.'
    
  The whole triumphant host
  Give thanks to God on high:
'Hail, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost'
    They ever cry:
  Hail, Abraham's God and mine!
  (I join the heav'nly lays)
All might and majesty are thine,
    And endless praise.
