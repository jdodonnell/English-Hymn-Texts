Annue, Christ, seaculorum Domine, before 11th cent.;
tr. Thomas A. Lacey (1853-1931), 1906

Lord of creation, bow thine ear, O Christ, to hear
The intercession of thy servant true and dear,
That we unworthy, who have trespassed in thy sight,
May live before thee where he dwells in glorious light.

O God our Savior, look on thine inheritance,
Sealed by the favor shining from thy countenance;
That no false spirit bring to naught the souls of price
Bought by the merit of thy perfect sacrifice.

We bear the burden of our guilt and enmity,
Until thy pardon lift the heart from slavery;
Then through the spending of thy life blood, King of grace,
Grant us unending triumph in thy holy place.

To Thee the glorious Christ, our Savior manifest,
All wreaths victorious, praise and worship be addressed,
Whom with the living Father humbly we adore,
And the life-giving Spirit, God for evermore.
