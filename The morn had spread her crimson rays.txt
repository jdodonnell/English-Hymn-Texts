Aurora lucis rutilat
Paschaltide. Lauds
tr. Robert Campbell

The morn had spread her crimson rays,
When rang the skies with shouts of praise;
Earth joined the joyful hymn to swell, 
That brought despair to vanquished hell

He comes victorious from the grave,
The Lord omnipotent to save,
And brings with him to light of day
The Saints who long imprisoned lay.

Vain is the cavern’s three-fold ward–
The stone, the seal, the armèd guard;
O death, no more thine arm we fear,
The Victor’s tomb is now thy bier.

Enough of death, enough of tears,
Enough of sorrows and of fears!
O hear yon white-robed angel cry,
Death’s Conqueror lives, no more to die.

Grant, Lord, in thee each faithful mind
Unceasing Paschal joy may find;
And from the death of sin set free
Souls newly born to life in thee.

To thee, once dead, who now dost live,
All glory, Lord, thy people give,
Whom, with the Father we adore,
And Holy Ghost for evermore. Amen.
