Ἰησοῠ γλκύτατε, Theoctistus, c. 890; 
tr. J.M. Neale (1818-1866), alt. (orig. "Jesu")

Jesus, name all names above;
Jesus, best and dearest;
Jesus, Fount of perfect love,
Holiest, tenderest, nearest:
Jesus, Source of grace completest;
Jesus purest, Jesus sweetest;
Jesus, Well of power Divine,
Make me, keep me, seal me thine!

Jesus, open me the gate
That of old he entered
Who, in that most lost estate,
Wholly on thee ventured;
Thou, whose wounds are ever pleading
And thy Passion interceding,
From my misery let me rise
To a home in Paradise!

Thou didst call the Prodigal:
Thou didst pardon Mary:
Thou whose words can never fall,
Love can never vary:
Lord, to heal my lost condition,
Give– for thou canst give– contrition,
Thou canst pardon all mine ill
If thou wilt: O say, “I will!”

Woe that I have turned aside
After fleshly pleasure!
Woe that I have never tried
For the heav’nly treasure!
Treasure, safe in homes supernal, 
Incorruptible, eternal;
Treasure no less price hath won
Than the Passion of the Son!

Jesus, crowned with thorns for me,
Scourged for my transgressioN!
Witnessing, through agony,
That thy good confession!
Jesus, clad in purple raiment,
For my evils making payment:
Let not all thy woe and pain,
Let not Calv’ry be in vain!

When I reach Death’s bitter sea
And its waves roll higher,
Help the more forsaking me
As the storm draws nigher:
Jesus, leave me not to languish,
Helpless, hopeless, full of anguish!
Tell me,– “Verily I say,
Thou shalt be with me today!”
