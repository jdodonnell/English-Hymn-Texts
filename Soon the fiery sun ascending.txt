Nocte Mox Diem Fugata
Corpus Christi.
Cluniac Breviary, 1686.
tr. Edward Caswall

Soon the fiery sun ascending
Will have chased the midnight gloom:
Rise, O Thou High Priest eternal,
Break the bondage of the tomb!
And above the vaulted sky
Bear Thy victim Flesh on high!

Once on earth for guilty mortals
Sacrificed in torment sore,
There may It, on Heav'n's high altar,
Plead our cause for evermore;
Opening the Way to God (alt.'d)
With the Lamb's atoning Blood.

Named of old High Priest for ever,
By the Father's stedfast oath,
Rise, O Advocate Almighty!
Rise, O Priest & Victim both!
Swiftly, swiftly, speed Thy way
Back to golden realms of day.

Lo, 'tis done ! O'er death victorious
Christ ascends His starry throne;
There from all His labors resting
Still He travails for His own;
Still our fate His Heart employs 
E'en amid eternal joys.

There He sits in tranquil glory;
There He stands His aid to lend;
There He offers to His Father 
Every single prayer we send;
There Himself receives each sigh
As omniscient Deity!
