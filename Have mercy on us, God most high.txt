Frederick W. Faber (1814-1863), 1849

Have mercy on us, God most high,
Who lift our hearts to thee;
Have mercy on us, worms of earth,
Most Holy Trinity.

Most ancient of all mysteries,
Before thy throne we lie;
Have mercy now, most merciful,
Most holy Trinity.

When heavâ€™n and earth were yet unmade, 
When time was yet unknown,
Thou in thy bliss and majesty
Didst live and love alone.

Thou wert not born; there was no fount
From which thy Being flowed;
There is no end which thou canst reach;
But thou art simply God.

How wonderful creation is,
The work which thou didst bless,
And O! what then must thou be like,
Eternal loveliness!

How beautiful the Angels are,
The Saints how bright in bliss;
But with thy beauty, Lord, compared,
How dull, how poor is this!
