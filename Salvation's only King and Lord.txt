Auctor saluten unice, __
Holy Saturday. Vespers
tr. St. Cecilia’s Abbey, Hymns for the Liturgy of the Hours, 1979

Salvation’s only King and Lord,
The world’s Redeemer, as foretold,
Christ Jesus, now bestow on us
The grace and glory of the Cross.

By dying you have conquered death,
True Life itself, you give us life,
No longer Satan can exult,
As crafty minister of doom.

By mourning love and tender hands, 
Your limbs within the tomb were laid,
While you descended to the shades
And set the old Law’s servants free.

At God the Father’s side enthroned,
Resplendent with those sacred wounds,
Hear now the prayer of those redeemed
By your life-giving precious Blood.

That as we strive to follow you
By blameless lives from day to day,
We may raise high the Holy Cross
Against the evil one’s assaults.

With Father and the Spirit One, 
All glory, Jesus, be to you,
Who by the triumph of the Cross
Will lead us to eternal life. Amen.
