ereden väg för Herran, Frans Mikael Franzèn, 1772-1847, 1812 (Swedish); tr. Augustus Nelson 1863-1949

Prepare the way, O Zion!
  Ye awful deeps, rise high;
Sink low, ye towering mountains,
  The Lord is drawing nigh;
The righteous King of glory,
Foretold in sacred story.

Refrain
O blest is He that came
In God the Father’s Name.

O Zion, He approacheth,
  Thy Lord and king for aye!
Strew palms where He advanceth,
  Spread garments in His way.
God’s promise faileth never,
Hosanna sound forever!

Fling wide thy portals, Zion
  And hail thy glorious king;
His tidings of salvation
  To every people bring,
Who, waiting yet in sadness,
Would sing His praise in gladness.

%{
He cometh not with warriors,
  And not with pomp and show,
Yet smiteth He with terror
  Sin, death, and every foe.
The Spirit’s sword He wieldeth,
Not e’en to death He yieldeth.

Give heed, thou sinful people,
  Thy king and Savior own;
The kingdom He hath founded
  Is not an earthly one;
No power can overthrow it,
Nor earthly wisdom know it.
%}

The throne which He ascendeth
  Is fixed in heaven above:
His sanctified dominion
  Is light alone and love.
His praise be ever sounding
For grace and peace abounding.

%{
Jerusalem is fallen,
  And closed its temple door;
Its sacrifices ended;
  Its scepter is no more.
Christ’s kingdom never ceaseth,
Its glory still increaseth.
