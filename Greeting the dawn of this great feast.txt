Optatus votis omnium
Ascension. Lauds

St. Cecilia’s Abbey

Greeting the dawn of this great feast
Our hearts are filled with joy today,
When we recall how Christ our God 
Ascended to the realms of light.

Victor for ever in the strife 
Against the prince of death and sin,
Glory of all creation’s hope,
Before the Father’s face he stands.

Brightest of clouds hid him from sight,
But pledge remained of life to come,
Since Paradise can now be ours 
Which our first parents lost by sin.

Greatest of joys mankind can claim,
That he whom Holy Mary bore,
Reigns at his Father’s side in pow’r,
His Cross and bitter Passion past.

Saving Avenger of our race,
To him our grateful hearts we raise;
In his immortal Deity
Our mortal nature dwells on high.

We have a lasting cause for joy,
Which all the saints and angels share;
Theirs is the bliss of seeing him,
and we too know that he is near.

Jesus, in splendor bright enthroned,
Keep all our hearts at rest in you,
Send down to us the Spirit blest
To teach the Father’s love for all. Amen.
