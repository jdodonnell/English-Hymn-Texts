Auctor beati saeculi
Sacred Heart of Jesus. Vespers
tr. Frederick Charles Husenbeth

O Christ, the world’s Creator bright,
Who didst mankind from sin redeem,
Light form the Father’s glorious Light,
True God of God in bliss supreme.

Thy love compelled thee to assume
A mortal body, man to save;
Reversing the old Adam’s doom;
Our ransom the new Adam gave.

That love which gloriously framed all–
The earth, the stars, and wond’rous sea–
Took pity on our parents’ fall, 
Broke all our bonds and set us free.

O Savior, let thy potent love 
Flow ever from thy bounteous Heart;
To nations that pure fount above
The grace of pardon will impart.

His Heart for this was opened wide,
And wounded by the soldier’s spear,
That freely from his sacred side
Might flow the streams our souls to clear.

Glory to Father and to Son,
And to the Holy Ghost the same,
To whom all pow’r, when time is done,
And endless rule, in endless fame. Amen.
