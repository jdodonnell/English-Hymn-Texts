O sola magnarum urbium, Prudentius, 4th cent.; tr. Edward Caswall (1814-1878), 1851

Bethlehem, of noblest cities
None can once with thee compare;
Thou alone the Lord from heaven
Didst for us Incarnate bear.

Fairer than the sun at morning
Was the star that told his birth;
To the lands their God announcing,
Hid beneath a form of earth.

By its lambent beauty guided,
See, the Eastern Kings appear;
See them bend, their gifts to offer,â€“
Gifts of incense, gold and myrrh.

Offerings of mystic meaning!_
Incense doth the God disclose;
Gold a Royal child proclaimeth;
Myrrh a future tomb foreshows.

Holy Jesus! in thy brightness
To the Gentile world displayed!
With the Father, and the Spirit,
Endless praise to thee be paid.
