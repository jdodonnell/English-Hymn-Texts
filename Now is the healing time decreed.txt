Ecce tempus idoneum, c. 12th cent.
tr. Thomas Alexander Lacey (1853-1931), The English Hymnal, 1906

Now is the healing time decreed
For sins of heart, of word or deed,
When we in humble fear record
The wrong that we have done the Lord;
Who, alway merciful and good,
Has borne so long our wayward mood,
Nor cut us off unsparingly
In our so great iniquity.

Therefore with fasting and with prayer,
Our secret sorrow we declare;
With all good striving seek his face,
And lowly hearted plead for grace.

Cleanse us, O Lord, from ev’ry stain,
Help us the meed of praise to gain,
Till with the angels linked in love
Joyful we tread thy courts above.

Father and Son and Spirit bles,
To thee be ev’ry prayer addressed,
Who art in three-fold Name adored,
From age to age, the only Lord. Amen.
