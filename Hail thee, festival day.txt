Salve, festa dies, Venantius Fortunatus (c. 530 – c. 600); 
tr. Maurice F. Bell (1862-1947), 1906

Hail thee, Festival Day! blest day that art hallowed for ever;
Day wherein Christ arose, breaking the kingdom of death.

Lo, the fair beauty of earth, from the death of the winter arising,
Ev’ry good gift of the year now with its Master returns.

He who was nailed to the Cross is God and the Ruler of all things;
All things created on earth worship the Maker of all.

God of all pity and pow’r, let thy Word be assured to the doubting;
Light on the third day returns: rise, Son of God, from the tomb!

Ill doth it seem that thy limbs should linger in lowly dishonor,
Ransom and price of the world, veiled from the vision of men.

Ill it beseemeth that thou, by whose hand all things are encompassed,
Captive and bound shouldst remain, deep in the bloom of the rock.

Rise now, O Lord, from the grave and cast off the shroud that enwrapped thee;
Thou art sufficient for us: nothing without thee exists.

Mourning they laid thee to rest, who art Author of life and creation;
Treading the pathway of death, life thou bestowedst on man. 

Show us thy face once more, that the ages may joy in thy brightness;
Give us the light of day, darkened on earth at thy death.

Out of the prison of death thou art rescuing numberless captives;
Freely thy tread in the way whither their Maker has gone.

Jesus has harrowed hell; he has led captivity captive:
Darkness and chaos and death flee from the face of the light.
