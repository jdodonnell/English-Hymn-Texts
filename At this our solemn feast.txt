Sacris solemniis iuncta sint gaudia
Corpus Christi. Office of Readings.
tr. John Chambers

At this our solemn feast
Let holy joys abound,
And from the inmost breast
Let songs of praise resound;
Let ancient rites depart,
And all be new around
In ev’ry deed, in voice, in heart.

Remember we that eve
When, the Last Supper spread,
Christ, as we all believe,
The lamb with leav’nless bread
Amongst his brethren shared 
And thus the Law obeyed,
Of old unto their sires declared.

The typic lamb consumed,
The Paschal feast complete,
The Lord unto the Twelve
His Body gave to eat;
The whole to all, no less
The whole to each, did mete
With his own hands, as we confess.

He gave them, weak and frail,
His Flesh their food to be;
On them, downcast and sad,
His Blood bestowed he;
And thus to them he spake,
“Receive this Cup from me,
And all of you of this partake.”

So he this Sacrifice
To institute did will,
And charged his priests alone
That office to fulfill
In them he did confide:
To whom pertaineth still
To take, and to the rest divide.

Thus Angels’ Bread is made
The Bread of man today;
The Living Bread from heav’n 
With figures doth away:
O wondrous gift indeed!
The poor and lowly, may
Upon their Lord and Master feed.

O Triune Deity,
To thee we meekly pray,
So may’st thou visit us,
As we our homage pay;
And in thy footsteps bright
Conduct us on our way
To where thou dwell’st in cloudless light. Amen.
