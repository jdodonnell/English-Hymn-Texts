Rejoice, the Lord is King,
  Your Lord and King adore;
Mortals, give thanks and sing,
  And triumph evermore:
    Life up your heart, lift up your voice;
    Rejoice, again I say, rejoice.
   
Jesus, the Savior, reigns,
  The God of truth and love;
When he had purged our stains,
  He took his seat above:
  
His kingdom cannot fail;
  He rules o'er earth adn heav'n;
The keys of death and hell
  Are to our Jesus giv'n:
  
He sits at God's right hand
  Till all his foes submit,
And bow to his command,
  And fall beneath his feet:
  
  Charles Wesley (1707-1788)
