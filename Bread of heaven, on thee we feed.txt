Josiah Conder (1789-1855), 1824, altered to plural

Bread of heaven, on thee we feed,
For thy Flesh is meat indeed;
Ever may our souls be fed
With this true and living Bread,
Day by day with strenth supplied
Through the life of him who died.

Vine of heaven, thy Blood supplies
This blest cup of sacrifice;
â€™Tis thy wounds our healing give;
To thy Cross we look and live:
Thou our life! O let us be
Rooted, grafted, built on thee.
