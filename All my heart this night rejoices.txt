Warum sollt' ich, Paul Gerhardt (1607-1676); tr. Catherine Winkworth, The Chorale Book for England

All my heart the night rejoices,
As I hear,
Far and near,
Sweetest angel voices; 
“Christ is born,” their choirs are singing,
Till the air
Ev’rywhere
Now with joy is ringing

Hark! a voice from yonder manger,
Soft and sweet,
Doth entreat,
“Flee from woe and danger;
Brethren, come, from all doth grieve you,
You are freed,
All you need
I will surely give you.”

Come then, let us hasten yonder;
Here let all, 
Great and small,
Kneel in awe and wonder,
Love Him who with love is yearning;
Hail the Star
That from far
Bright with hope is burning!

Ye who pine in weary sadness,
Weep no more, 
For the door
Now is found of gladness.
Cling to Him, for He will guide you
Where no cross, 
Pain or loss
Can again betide you.

Thee, dear Lord, with heed I’ll cherish, 
Live to Thee, 
And with Thee
Dying, shall not perish;
But shall dwell with Thee for ever,
Far on high,
In the joy
That can alter never.
