Francis Pott (1832-1909), 1861, “Hymns fitted to the Order of Common Prayer”

Angel voices, ever singing,
Round thy throne of light,
Angel harps, forever ringing,
Rest not day or night;
Thousands only live to bless thee,
And confess thee 
Lord of might.

Thou Who art beyond the farthest
Mortal eye can scan,
Can it be that thou regardest
Songs of sinful man?
Can we feel that thou art near us
And wilt hear us? 
Yea, we can.

Yea, we know thy love rejoices 
O’er each for of thine;
Thou didst ears and hands and voices
For thy praise combine;
Craftsman’s art and music’s measure
For thy pleasure
All combine.

Here, great God, today we offer
Of thine own to thee;
And for thine acceptance proffer,
All unworthily,
Hearts and minds, and hands and voices,
In our choicest
Melody.

Honor, glory, might and merit,
Thine shall ever be,
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,
Blesséd Trinity;
Of the best that thou hast given
Earth and Heaven
Render thee.
