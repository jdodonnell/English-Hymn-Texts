Conditor alme siderum, 7th cent.
1st Vespers of Advent I until Dec. 16 
tr. John Mason Neale (1818-1866), 1851

Creator of the stars of night, Thy people’s everlasting light;  Jesu, Redeemer, save us all, And hear thy servants when they call.

Thou, grieving that the ancient curse Should doom to death an universe, Hast found the med’cine, full of grace, To save and heal a ruin’d race.

Thou cam’st, the Bridegroom of the Bride, As drew the world to ev'ning-tide; Proceeding from a Virgin shrine, The spotless Victim all divine.

At whose dread Name, majestic now, All knees must bend, all hearts must bow And things celestial thee shall own, And things terrestrial, Lord alone.

O thou, whose coming is with dread To judge and doom the quick and dead, Preserve us, while we dwell below, From ev’ry insult of the foe.

To God the Father, God the Son,
And God the Spirit, Three in One,
Laud, honour, might, and glory be
From age to age eternally. Amen.
