Victimae paschali laudes, Wipo; tr. Jane Elizabeth Leeson (18-7-1882) in H. Fornby’s Catholic Hymns, 1851

Christ the Lord is ris’n today:
Christians, haste your vows to pay;
Offer ye your praises meet
At the Paschal Victim’s feet.

For the sheep the Lamb hath bled,
Sinless in the sinner’s stead;
Christ he Lord is ris’n on high, 
Now he lives no more to die.

Christ, the Victime undeflied,
Man to God hath reconciled;
Whilst in strange and awful strife
Met together Death and Life.

Christians, on this happy day
Haste with joy your vows to pay;
Christ the Lord is ris’n on high, 
Now he lives no more to die.

Say, O wond’ring Mary, say,
What thou sawest on they way?
“I beheld, where Christ had lain, 
Empty tomb and angels twain.

I beheld the glory bright
Of the rising Lord of light:
Christ y hope is ris’n again,
Now he lives, and lives to reign.”

Christ, who once for sinners bled, 
Now the first-born from the dead,
Thron’d in endless might and pow’r,
Lives and reigns for evermore.

Hail, eternal Hope on high!
Hail, thou King of victory!
Hail, thou prince of life adored!
Help and save us, gracious Lord!
