Isaac Watts (1674-1748), 1719

Jesus shall reign where’er the sun
Does his successive journeys run;
His kingdom stretch from shore to shore,
Till moons shall wax and wane no more.

For him shall endless prayer be made,
And praises throng to crown his head;
His Name, like sweet perfume, shall rise
With ev’ry morning sacrifice.

People and realms of ev’ry tongue 
Dwell on his love with sweetest song;
And infant voices shall proclaim
Their early blessings on his Name. 

Blessings abound where’er he reigns;
The pris’ner leaps to lose his chains,
the weary find eternal rest,
And all the sons of want are blest.

Let ev’ry creature rise and bring
Peculiar honors to our King,
Angels descend with songs again,
And earth repeat the loud Amen.
