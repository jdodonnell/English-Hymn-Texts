Tu, Trinitatis Unitas.
Trinity Sunday. Lauds
anon.

Thou Trinity in Unity
Who rulest all things mightily, 
Bow down to hear the songs of praise
Which we, thy wakeful servants, raise.

The daystar’s rays are glitt’ring clear,
And tell that day itself is near;
The shadows of the night depart;
Thou, holy Light, illume the heart.

To God the Father glory be,
And to the sole begotten Son,
And Holy Ghost coequally,
While everlasting ages run. Amen.
