Now the laborer’s toils are o’er
Fought the battle, won the crown:
On life’s rough and barren shore
Thou hast laid thy burden down:

Grant him, Lord, eternal rest,
With the spirits of the blest.

Angels bear thee to the land
Where the towers of Sion rise;
Safely lead thee by the hand
To the fields of Paradise:

White-robed, at the golden gate
Of the new Jerusalem,
May the host of Martyrs wait;
Give the part and lot with them:

Friends and dear ones gone before
To the land of endless peace,
Meet thee on that further shore
Where all tears and weeping cease:

Rest in peace: the gates of hell
Touch thee not, till he shall come
For the souls he loves so well,–
Dear Lord of the heav’nly home:

Earth to earth, and dust to dust,
Clay we give to kindred clay,
In the sure and certain trust
Of the Resurrection day:
