Christe nostrum gaudium, c. 5th cent.;
tr. Laurence Housman (1865-1959), 1906

O Christ, our joy, to whom is giv’n
A throne o’er all the thrones of heav’n,
In thee, whose hand all things obey,
The world’s vain pleasures pass away.

So, suppliants here, we seek to win
Thy pardon for thy people’s sin,
That, by thine all-prevailing grace,
Uplifted, we may seek thy face.

And when, all heav’n beneath thee bowed,
Thou com’st to judgement throned in cloud,
Then from our guilt wash out the stain
And give us our lost crowns again.

Be thou our joy and strong defense,
Who art our future recompense:
So shall the light that springs from thee
Be ours through all eternity.

O risen Christ, ascended Lord,
All praise to thee let earth accord,
Who art, while endless ages run,
With Father, and with Spirit One. Amen.
