Supernae matris gaudia, Adam of St. Victor, c. 1150;
tr. Robert Bridges (1844-1930), 1899

Joy and triumph everlasting
Hath the heav’nly Church on high;
For that pure immortal gladness
All our feast-days mourn and sigh:
Yet in death’s dark desert wild
Doth the mother aid her child,
Guards celestial thence attend us,
Stand in combat to defend us.

Here the world’s perpetual warfare
Holds from heav’n the soul apart;
Legioned foes in shadowy terror
Vex the Sabbath of the heart.
O how happy that estate
Where delight doth not abate;
For that home the spirit yearneth,
Where none languisheth nor mourneth.

There the body hath no torment,
There the mind is free from care,
There is ev’ry voice rejoicing,
Ev’ry heart is loving there.
Angels in that city dwell;
Them their King delighteth well:
Still they joy and weary never, 
More and more desiring, ever.

There the seers and fathers holy,
There the prophets glorified,
All their doubts and darkness ended,
In the Light of light abide.
There the Saints, whose mem’ries old
We in faithful hymns uphold,
Have forgot their bitter story
In the joy of Jesus’ glory.

There from lowliness exalted
Dwelleth Mary, Queen of grace,
Ever with her presence pleading
‘Gainst the sin of Adam’s race.
To that glory of the blest,
By their prayers and faith confest,
Us, us too, when death hath freed us,
Christ of his good mercy lead us.
