Φῶς Ἱλαρόν, Phos hilaron," Ancient Greek hymn; 
tr. Robert S. Bridges (1844-1930), 1899

O gladsome light, O grace
Of God the Father’s face,
The_eternal splendor wearing;
Celestial, holy, blest,
Our Savior Jesus Christ,
Joyful in thine appearing.

Now, ere day fadeth quite,
We see the ev’ning light,
Our wonted hymn outpouring;
Father of might unknonw,
Thee, his incarnate Son,
And Holy Spirit adoring.

To thee of right belongs
All praise of holy songs,
O Son of God, Lifegiver;
Thee, therefore, O Most High,
The world doth glorify,
And shall exalt for ever.
