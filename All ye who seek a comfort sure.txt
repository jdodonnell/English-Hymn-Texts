Quicumque cerium quaeritis, 18th cent.; tr. E. Casual, alt. The English Hymnal, 1906

All ye who seek a comfort sure
In trouble and distress,
Whatever sorrow vex the mind,
Or guilt the soul oppress.

Jesus, who gave himself for you
Upon the Cross to die,
Opens to you his sacred Heart;
O to that Heart draw nigh.

Ye hear how kindly he invites;
Ye hear his words so blest
“All ye that labour come to me,
And I will give you rest.”

O Jesus, joy of Saints on high, 
Thou hope of sinners here,
Attracted by those loving words
To thee I lift my prayer.

Wash thou my wounds in that dear Blood
Which forth from thee doth flow;
New grace, new hope inspire, a new
And better heart bestow.
