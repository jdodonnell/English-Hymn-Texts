See the Conquerer Mounts in Triumph, vs. 5-7, Wordsworth (1807-1885), 1862

Holy Ghost, Illuminator,
Shed thy beams upon our eyes,
Help us to look up with Stephen,
And to see beyond the skies,
Where the Son of Man in glory
Standing is at God’s right hand,
Beck’ning on his Martyr army,
Succoring his faithful band;

See him, who is gone before us,
Heav’nly mansions to prepare,
See him, who is ever pleading 
For us with prevailing prayer,
See him who with sound of trumpet
And with his angelic train,
Summoning the world to judgement,
On the clouds will come again.

Glory be to God the Father;
Glory be to God the Son,
Dying, ris’n, ascending for us,
Who the heav’nly realm has won;
Glory to the Holy Spirit;
To One God in persons Three;
Glory both in earth and heaven, 
Glory, endless glory, be.
