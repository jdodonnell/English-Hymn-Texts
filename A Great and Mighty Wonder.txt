Μέγα χαί παράδοξον θαυμα, St. Germanus, 734; tr. J.M. Neale, 1862, alt.
(from the English Hymnal)

A great and mighty wonder
A full and holy cure!
The Virgin bears the Infant
With virgin-honour pure.

Repeat the hymn again:
'To God on high be glory,
And peace on earth to men!'

The Word becomes Incarnate,
And yet remains on high:
And Cherubim sing anthems
To shepherds from the sky.

While thus they sing your Monarch
Those bright angelic bands,
Rejoice, ye vales and mountains,
Ye oceans, clap your hands.

Since all he comes to ransom,
By all be he adored,
The Infant born in Beth’lem,
The Saviour and the Lord.

And idol forms shall perish,
And error shall decay,
And Christ shall wield his sceptre;
Our Lord and God for aye.
