Sancti, venite, Christi corpus sumite, St. Sechnall (d. 457), c. 7th cent.;
tr. J.M. Neale (1818-1866), 1861 

Draw nigh and take the Body fo the Lord,
And drink the holy Blood for you outpoured.

Saved by that Body and that holy Blood,
With souls refreshed, we render thanks to God.

Salvation’s giver, Christ, the only Son,
By his dear cross and Blood the vict’ry won.

Offered was he for greateest and for least
Himself the Victim, and Himself the Preist.

Victims were offered by the law of old,
That in a type celestial mysteries told.

He, Ransomer from death, and Light from shade
Now gives his holy grace, his saints to aid.

He, that his saints in this world rules and shields,
To all believers life eternal yields;

With heavenly bread makes them that hunger whole,
Gives living waters to the thirsting soul.

Alpha and Omega, to Whom shall bow
All nations at the doom, is with us now.
