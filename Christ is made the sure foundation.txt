Angularis fundamentum, Feast of the Dedication of a Church; tr. John Mason Neale (1818-1866), 1851

Christ is made the sure foundation
And the precious Cornerstone,
Who, the two-fold walls surmounting, 
Binds them closely into one:
Holy Sionâ€™s help for ever,
And her confidence alone.

All that dedicated city,
Dearly loved by God on high,
In exultant jubilation
pours perpetual melody;
God the One and God the Trinal
Singing everlastingly.

To this temple, where we call thee
Come, O Lord of Hosts, today!
With thy wonted loving-kindness
Hear thy people as they pray;
And thy fullest benediction
Shed within its walls for aye.

Here vouchsafe to all thy servants 
That they supplicate to gain,
Here to have and hold for ever
Those good things their prayers obtain:
And here-after in thy glory
With thy blessed ones to reign.

Laud and honor to the Father
Laud and honor to the Son;
Laud and honor to the Spirit;
Ever Three, and ever One:
Consubstantial, coeternal, 
While unending ages run.
