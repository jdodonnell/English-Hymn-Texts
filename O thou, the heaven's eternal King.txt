O Rex aeterne, Domine, c. 5th-6th cent.
Paschaltide. Vespers (ad libitum)
tr. Edward Caswall (1814-1878)

O thou, the heavens’ eternal King, 
Creator, unto thee we sing,
With God the Father ever One, 
Co-equal, co-eternal Son.

Thy hand, when first the world began,
Made in thine own pure image man,
And yoked to fleshly form of earth
A living form of heavenly birth.

And when the envy of the foe
Had marred thy noblest work below,
Clothed in our flesh, thou didst restore
The image thou hadst made before.

Once wast thou born of Mary’s womb;
And now, newborn from out the tomb,
O Christ, thou bidd’st us rise with thee
From death to immortality.

Eternal Shepherd, thou art won’t
To cleanse thy people at the font, 
That mystic bath, that grave of sin,
Where ransomed souls new life begin.

Redeemer, thou for us didst deign
To hang upon the Cross of pain, 
And give for us the lavish price 
Of thine own Blood in sacrifice.

Grant, Lord, in thee each faithful mind
Unceasing Paschal joy may find;
And from the death of sin set free
Souls newly born to life in thee.

To thee, once dead, who now dost live,
All glory, Lord, thy people give,
Whom, with the Father, we adore, 
And Holy Ghost for evermore. Amen.
