Vom Himmel hoch, da komm ich her, Martin Luther (1483-1546), 1535;
tr. Catherine Winkworth (1827-1878)

From heav’n above to earth I come
To bear good news to ev’ry home;
Glad tidings of great joy I bring,
Whereof I now will say and sing.

The Father’s light and splendor thou,
Their endless hope to thee that bow;
Accept the prayers and praise today
That through the world thy servants pay.

Salvation’s author, call to mind
How, taking form of humankind,
Born of a Virgin undefiled,
Thou in man’s flesh becam’st a child.

Thus testifies the present day,
Through ev’ry year in long array,
That thou, salvation’s source alone,
Proceededst from the Father’s throne.

Whence sky, and stars, and sea’s abyss,
And earth and all that therein is,
Shall still, with laud and carol meet,
The Author of thine advent greet.
