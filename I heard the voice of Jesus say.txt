Horatius Bonar (1808-1889), 1846; alt. v.1, line 6

I heard the voice of Jesus say,
“Come unto me and rest;
Lay down, O weary one, lay down
Thy head upon my breast.”
I came to Jesus as I was, 
So weary, worn, and sad;
I found in him a resting place,
And he has made me glad.

I heard the voice of Jesus say, 
“Behold, I freely give
The living water, thirsty one;
Stoop down and drink and live.”
I came to Jesus, and I drank
Of that life-giving stream;
My thirst was quenched, my soul revived,
And now I live in him.

I heard the voice of Jesus say, 
“I am this dark world’s Light;
Look unto me, thy morn shall rise,
And all thy day be bright:”

I looked to Jesus, and I found
In him my Star, my Sun;
And in that light of life I’ll walk
Till trav’ling days are done.
