Tibi, Redemptor omnium, c. 5th-6th cent.
Holy Saturday. Lauds
tr. St. Cecilia’s Abbey, Hymns for the Liturgy of the Hours, 1979

Redeemer of our fallen race
With contrite heart we sing to you;
Forgive us, Lord, we humbly pray, 
Forgive us who confess your Name.

The pow’r of Satan and his hordes
You broke by death upon the Cross; 
Signed on the forehead with this seal
We bear the banner of our faith.

His grim dominion over us
You deigned to shatter and dispel,
Lest he for ever should do harm
To souls once ransomed by your Blood.

You visited the gloom of hell
To lead to everlasting joy
The faithful of the ancient Law,
Awaiting you in silent hope.

Alone you know the certain time
When this our world must pass away,
And when as Judge of every soul
You will award what justice claims.

So heal our wounds, we beg, this day
O Savior, Jesus Christ, our Lord,
Who with the Father will be praised
For ever with the Spirit blessed. Amen.
