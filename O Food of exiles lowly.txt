O esca viatorum, Maintzisch Gesangbuch;
tr. M. Owen Lee (b. 1930), The New St. Basil Hymnal, alt.

O Food of exiles lowly,
O Bread of angels holy, 
O Manna from on high!
We hunger for your blessing,
All good in you possessing,
With favor hear our heart’s outcry.

O cleansing Water, streaming
From Jesus’ side, redeeming
All men of Adam’s race!
O limpid Fountain flowing,
Our ev’ry want bestowing,
O come and fill our souls with grace.

O Lord, we kneel before you
And fervently adore you,
All hid beneath this bread.
But make to us this promise:
To see you in your fullness,
The sacred Body’s mystic head.
