Christe Redemptor omnium, 6th cent.;
tr. John Mason Neale (1818-1866)

Jesus, the Father’s only Son,
Whose death for all redemption won;
Before the worlds, of God most high
Begotten all ineffably.

The Father’s light and splendor thou,
Their endless hope to thee that bow;
Accept the prayers and praise today
That through the world thy servants pay.

Salvation’s author, call to mind
How, taking form of humankind,
Born of a Virgin undefiled,
Thou in man’s flesh becam’st a child.

Thus testifies the present day,
Through ev’ry year in long array,
That thou, salvation’s source alone,
Proceededst from the Father’s throne.
