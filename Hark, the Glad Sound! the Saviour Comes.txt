Philip Doddridge, 1702-1751, 1735

Hark, the glad sound! the Savior comes,
  The Savior promised long!
Let every heart prepare a throne,
 And every voice a song.

He comes the prisoners to release
  In Satan’s bondage held;
The gates of brass before him burst,
  The iron fetters yield.

He comes the broken heart to bind,
  The bleeding soul to cure,
And with the treasures of his grace
  To enrich the humble poor.

Our glad hosannas, Prince of Peace,
  Thy welcome shall proclaim,
And heaven’s eternal arches ring
  With thy beloved Name.
