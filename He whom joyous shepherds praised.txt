Quem pastores laudavere, 1410;
tr. Charles Winfred Douglas (1867-1944), 1940

He whom joyous shepherds praisèd,
When the angel’s song was raisèd
Bidding them be not amazèd, 
Heav’n’s all-glorious King is born.

He whom sages, westward faring,
Myrrh and gold and incense bearing,
Worshipped, bowing low before him,
Reighns as King this happy morn.

Now rejoice with Jesus’ mother;
Praise her new-born song, our brother;
Angels vie with one another,
Praising him beyond the sky.

Sing to Christ, the King who reigneth,
Yet of Mary manhood gaineth,
Born our God; let us adore him:
Glory be to God on high.
