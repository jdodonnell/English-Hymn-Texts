Cecil F. Alexander

Refrain:
All things bright and beautiful, 
all creatures great and small, 
all things wise and wonderful, 
the Lord God made them all.

Each little flower that opens, 
Each little bird that sings, 
He made their glowing colors, 
He made their tiny wings. [Refrain]

The purple-headed mountain, 
The river running by, 
The sunset, and the morning 
that brightens up the sky: [Refrain]

The cold wind in the winter, 
The pleasant summer sun, 
the ripe fruits in the garden, 
He made them every one. [Refrain]

He gave us eyes to see them, 
And lips that we might tell 
How great is God Almighty, 
Who hath made all things well. [Refrain]
