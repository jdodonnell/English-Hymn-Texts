Verbum supernum prodiens, c. 10th cent.;
tr. Charles Bigg (1840-1908), 1906

High Word of God, who once didst come,
Leaving thy Father and thy home,
To succor by thy birth our kind,
When, towards thy advent, time declined,

Pour light upon us from above,
And fire our hearts with thy strong love,
That, as we hear thy Gospel read,
All fond desires may flee in dread;

That when thou comest from the skies,
Great Judge, to open thine assize,
To give each hidden sin its smart,
And crown as kings the pure in heart,

We be not set at thy left hand,
Where sentence due would bid us stand,
But with the Saints thy face may see,
For ever wholly loving thee.

Praise to the Father and the Son,
Through all the ages as they run;
And to the holy Paraclete
Be praise with them and worship meet.
