De profundis exclamantes, 13th cent.; tr. Richard Frederick Littledale (1833-1890)

Christ, enthroned in highest heaven, 
Hear us crying from the deep,
For the faithful ones departed,
For the souls of all that sleep;
As thy kneeling Church entreateth
Hearken, Shepherd of the sheep.

King of Glory, hear our voices,
Grant thy faithful rest, we pray;
We have sinned, and may not bide it,
If thou mark our steps astray,
Yet we plead that saving Victim,
Which for them we bring today.

That which thou thyself hast offered
To thy Father, offer we;
Let it win for them a blessing,
Bless them, Jesus, set them free:
They are thine, they wait in patience,
Merciful and gracious be.

They are thine, O take them quickly,
Thou their Hope, O raise them high;
Ever hoping, ever trusting,
Unto thee they strive and cry;
Day and night, both morn and even,
Be, O Christ, their Guardian nigh.

Let thy plenteous loving-kindness
On them as we pray, be poured;
Let them through thy boundless mercy,
From all evil be restored;
Hearken to the gentle pleading
Of thy Mother, gracious Lord.

When, O kind and radiant Jesus, 
Kneels the Queen thy throne before,
Let the court of Saints attending,
Mercy for the dead implore;
Hearken, loving Friend of sinners,
Whom the Cross exalted bore.

Hear and answer prayers devoutest,
Break, O Lord, each binding chain,
Dahs the gates of death asunder,
Quell the devil and his train;
Bring the souls which thou hast ransomed 
Evermore in joy to reign.
Amen.
