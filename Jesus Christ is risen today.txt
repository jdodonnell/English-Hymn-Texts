Based on Surrexit Christus hodie, 14th cent.; traditional text, various authors

Jesus Christ is ris’n today,
Our triumphant holy day;
Who did once, upon the cross,
Suffer to redeem our loss.

Hymns of praise then let us sing
Unto Christ our heav’nly King:
Who endured the cross and grave,
Sinners to redeem and save.

But the pains which he endured
Our salvation hath procured:
Now above the sky he’s King,
Where the angels ever sing. 

Sing we to our God above–
Praise eternal as his love;
Praise him all ye heav’nly host,
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
