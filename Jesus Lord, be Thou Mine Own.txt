Mondo, più per me non sei - St. Alphonsus de Liguori
tr. E. Vaughan

Jesus Lord, be Thou mine own;
Thee I long for, Thee alone;
All myself I give to Thee;
Do what-e’er Thou wilt with me.

Life without Thy Love would be
Death, O Sov’reign Good, to me;
Bound and held by Thy dear chains
Captive now my heart remains.

Thou, O God, my heart inflame,
Give that love which Thou dost claim;
Payment I will ask for none;
Love demands but love alone.

God of beauty, Lord of Light,
Thy good will is my delight;
Now henceforth Thy will divine
Ever shall in all be mine.
