Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme, Philipp Nicolai (1556-1608), 1599
tr. Catherine Winkworth (1827-1878), 1858

Wake, awake, for night is flying,
The watchmen on the heights are crying;
  Awake, Jerusalem, at last!
Midnight hears the welcome voices,
And at the thrilling cry rejoices:
  Come forth, ye virgins, night is past. 
    The Bridegroom comes, awake,
    Your lamps with gladness take
      Hallelujah!
And for His marriage-feast prepare,
For ye must go to meet Him there.

Zion hears the watchmen singing,
And all her heart with joy is springing,
  She wakes, she rises from her gloom;
For her Lord comes down all-glorious,
The strong in grace, in truth victorious,
  Her Star is ris'n, her Light is come!
    Ah come, Thou blessed One,
    God's own Belov√®d Son,
      Hallelujah!
We follow till the halls we see
Where Thou hast bid us sup with Thee!

Now let all the heav'ns adore Thee,
And men and angels sing before Thee
  With harp and cymbal's clearest tone;
Of one pearl each shining portal,
Where we are with the choir immortal
  Of an -- gels round Thy dazzling throne;
    Nor eye hath seen, nor ear
    Hath yet attain'd to hear
      What there is ours,
But we rejoice, and sing to Thee
Our hymn of joy eternally.
