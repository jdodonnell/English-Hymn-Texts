Adeste, fideles, John Francis Wade (1711-1786);
tr. Frederick Oakely (1802-1880), W T Brooke (1848-1917), and others.

O come, all ye faithful, 
Joyful and triumphant, 
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem;
Come and behold him
Born the King of Angels:

O come, let us adore him,
O come, let us adore him,
O come, let us adore him, Christ the Lord!

God of God, Light of Light,
Lo! he abhors not the Virgin’s womb;
Very God, 
Begotten, not created:

See how the Shepherds,
Summoned to his cradle,
Leaving their flocks, draw nigh with lowly fear;
We too will thither
Bend our joyful footsteps:

Lo! star-led chieftains,
Magi, Christ adoring,
Offer him incense, gold, and myrrh;
We to the Christ Child
Bring our hearts’ oblations:

Child, for us sinners
Poor and in the manger,
Fain we embrace thee, with awe and love;
Who would not love thee,
Loving us so darly?

Sing, choirs of Angels,
Sing in exultation,
Sing, all ye citizens of heav’n above;
Glory to God,
All glory in the highest.

Yea, Lord, we greet thee,
Born this happy morning,
Jesus, to thee be all glory giv’n;
Word of the Father,
Now in flesh appearing:
