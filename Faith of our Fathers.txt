Frederick William Faber (1814-1863), 1849, v. 3 alt.

Faith of our Fathers! living still
In spite of dungeon, fire and sword:
Oh, how our hearts beat high with joy
Whene’er we hear that glorious word.

Faith of our fathers, holy faith!
We will be true to thee till death.

Our Father’s chained in prisons dark,
Were still in heart and conscience free:
How sweet would be their children’s fate,
If they, like them, could die for thee!

Faith of our Fathers! Mary’s prayers
Shall win all nations back to thee;
And through the truth that comes form God
All men shall then indeed be free.

Faith of our Fathers! we will love
Both friend and foe in all our strife:
And preach thee too, as love knows how
By kindly words and virtuous life:
