Komm, du wertes Loesegeld, Johann G. Olearius (1635-1711), 1699
tr. August Crull (1846-1923), 1923

Come, thou precious Ransom, come,
Only hope for sinful mortals!
Come, O Savior of the world!
Open are to thee all portals.
Come, Thy beauty let us see;
Anxiously we wait for Thee.

Enter now my waiting heart,
Glorious King and Lord most holy.
Dwell in me and ne'er depart,
Though I am but poor and lowly.
Ah, what riches will be mine
When thou art my guest divine!

My hosannas and my palms
Graciously receive, I pray thee;
Evermore, as best I can,
Savior, I will homage pay thee,
And in faith I will embrace,
Lord, thy merit through thy grace.

Hail! Hosanna, David's Son!
Jesus, hear our supplication!
Let thy kingdom, scepter, crown,
Bring us blessing and salvation,
That forever we may sing:
Hail! Hosanna to our King.
