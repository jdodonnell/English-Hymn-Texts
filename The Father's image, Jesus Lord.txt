Aeterna imago Altissimi
Christ the King. Lauds
tr. St. Cecilia’s Abbey.


The Father’s image, Jesus Lord, 
Eternal God, True Light’s true Beam,
To you, Redeemer of all men,
All glory, honor, pow’r supreme.

Before all time you ruled alone,
Then hope of ages you became,
To your sweet yoke we gladly bow
And your supremacy proclaim.

The Second Adam of our race,
You are the Flow’r of Virgin birth,
The stone that crushed the kingdom’s might
And grew until it filled the earth.

Ensnared by evil demon’s wiles,
Man lost the grace he had before,
But you have conquered sin and death
And heaven is our hope once more.

Our Teacher, Priest, Lawgiver too,
New life to all your triumph brings;
Your blood-stained robe reveals your Name:
The Lord of lords and King of kings.

Unending glory be to Christ,
Who by his Blood our ransom paid;
The Spirit’s Love, the Father’s Will, 
Decreed the plan which he obeyed.
Amen.
