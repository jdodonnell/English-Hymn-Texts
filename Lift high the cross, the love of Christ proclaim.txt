Lift high the cross, 
the love of Christ proclaim 
till all the world 
adore his sacred Name.

Come, brethren, follow where our Captain trod,
our King victorious, Christ the Son of God.

Led on their way by this triumphant sign,
the hosts of God in conquering ranks combine.

Each newborn soldier of the Crucified
bears on the brow the seal of him who died.

This is the sign which Satanâ€™s legions fear 
and angels veil their faces to revere.

Saved by this Cross whereon their Lord was slain, 
the sons of Adam their lost home regain.From north and south, from east and west they raise 
in growing unison their songs of praise.
O Lord, once lifted on the glorious tree,as thou hast promised, draw the world to thee.
Let every race and every language tellof him who saves our souls from death and hell.
From farthest regions let their homage bring, 
and on his Cross adore their Savior King.
Set up thy throne, that earth's despair may cease 
beneath the shadow of its healing peace.
For thy blest Cross which doth for all atone 
creation's praises rise before thy throne.
