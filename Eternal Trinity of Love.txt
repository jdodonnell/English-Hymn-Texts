The Stanbrook Abbey Hymnal, 1974

Eternal Trinity of love, 
In peace and majesty you reign,
All things come forth from you alone,
To you they must return again.

Creation lives and breathes in you,
Sustained by your almighty will;
Grant us to know you, God of truth,
In whom the questing mind is still.

Our Father, in the name of Christ, 
Unceasingly your Spirit send;
Be with us, everlasting God:
Fulfill your purpose to the end.

We praise you, God-head, One in Three,
Immortal Trinity of light;
Unchanging through eternal days,
You live unmoved, serene in might. Amen.
