Who is this so weak and helpless,
  Child of lowly Hebrew maid,
Rudely in a stable sheltered,
   Coldly in a manger laid?
'Tis the Lord of all creation,
  Who this wondrous path hath trod;
He is God from everlasting,
  And to everlasting God.

Who is this - a Man of Sorrows,
  Walking sadly life's hard way;
Homeless, weary, sighing, weeping
  Over sin and Satan's sway?
'Tis our God, our glorious Savior,
  Who beyond our mortal sight
Now for us a place prepareth
  Free from grief and full of light.

Who is this - behold him raining
  Drops of blood upon the ground?
Who is this - despised, rejected,
  Mocked, insulted, beaten, bound?
'Tis our God, who gifts and graces
  On his Church now poureth down;
Who shall smite in holy vengeance
  All his foes beneath his throne.

Who is this that hangeth dying,
  With the thieves on either side?
Nails his hands and feet are tearing,
  And the spear hath pierced his side.
'Tis the God who ever liveth
  'Mid the shining ones on high,
In the glorious golden city
  Reigning everlastingly.
  
  William Walsham How (1823-1897)
