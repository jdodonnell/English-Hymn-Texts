Veni Creator Spiritus, Rabanus Maurus, 8th cent.; tr. Edward Caswall, alt. traditional

Come, Holy Ghost, Creator blest,
And in our hearts take up thy rest;
Come with thy grace and heav’nly aid,
To fill the hearts which thou hast made.

O Comforter to thee we cry,
Thou heav’nly Gift of God most high
Thou Fount of life and fire of love,
And sweet annointing from above.

O Holy Ghost, through thee alone,
Know we the Father and the Son,
Be this our never changing creed,
That thou dost form them both proceed.

Praise we that Father and the Son,
And Holy Spirit with them One; 
And may the Son on us bestow
The gifts that from the Spirit flow.
