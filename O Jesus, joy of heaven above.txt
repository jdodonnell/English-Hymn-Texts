O lux beata caelitum
Holy Family. Vespers
St. Cecilia’s Abbey, Hymns for the Liturgy of the Hours, 1979

O Jesus, joy of heav'n above,
And highest hope of mortal man,
The purest love that home can know
Surrounded your frail infancy.

O Mary, rich in ev’ry grace,
Your privilege was quite unique:
To feed your Son and infant God,
And softly kiss his tiny cheek.

Most favored patriarch of all, 
Th Virgin Mother’s strength and stay,
The chosen guardian of your Lord,
Who called you father day by day.

All three from Jesse’s nobel stem,
And to born to do salvation’s work,
Pay heed to all the earliest prayers 
We trustfully pour out to you.

As your home flourished with the grace
Of ev’ry virtue’s fairest flow’r,
In love and peace may all our homes
Reflect a little of your own.

O Jesus, Virgin-born, we raise
Our hearts to you in joyful praise,
Whom with the Father we adore,
And Holy Spirit, evermore.
