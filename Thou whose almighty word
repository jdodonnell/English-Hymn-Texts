Thou whose almighty word
Chaos and darkness heard,
  And took their flight;
Hear us, we humbly pray,
And where the gospel day
Sheds not its glorious ray,
  Let there be light.

Thou, who didst come to bring
On thy redeeming wing
  Healing and sight,
Health to the sick in mind,
Sight to the inly blind,
O now to all mankind
  Let there be light.
  
Spirit of truth and love,
Life-giving, holy Dove,
  Speed forth thy flight;
Move o'er the waters' face,
Bearing the lamp of grace,
And in earth's darkest place,
  Let there be light.
  
Blessed and holy Three,
Glorious Trinity,
  Wisdom, Love, and Might,
Boundless as ocean's tide
Rolling in fullest pride,
Through the world far and wide
  Let there be light.
  
John Marriott (1780-1825)
