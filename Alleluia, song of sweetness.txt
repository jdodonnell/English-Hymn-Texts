Alleluia, dulce carmen, 11th C. 
tr. John M. Neale (1818-1866); alt. Hymns Ancient and Modern, 1875

Alleluia, song of sweetness, 
Voice of joy that cannot die;
Alleluia is the anthem
Ever dear to choirs on high;
In the house of God abiding
Thus they sing eternally.

Alleluia thou resoundest,
True Jerusalem and free;
Alleluia, joyful Mother,
All thy children sing with thee;
But by Babylonâ€™s sad waters
Mourning exiles now are we.

Alleluia cannot always
Be our song while here below;
Alleluia our transgressions
Make us for awhile forego;
For the solemn time is coming
When our tears for sin must flow.

Therefore in our hymns we pray Thee,
Grant us, Blessed Trinity,
At the last to keep Thine Easter
In our home beyond the sky,
There to Thee for ever singing
Alleluia joyfully.
