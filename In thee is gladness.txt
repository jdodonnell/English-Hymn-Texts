In dir ist Freude, J. Kindemann (1549-1631), 1598;
tr. Catherine Winkworth (1827-1878), 1858

In thee is gladness, amid all sadness,
Jesus, sunshine of my heart.
By thee are given the gifts of Heaven,
Thou the true Redeemer art.

Our souls thou makest,
Our bonds thou breakest;
Who trusts thee surely 
Hath built securely,
And stands for ever. Alleluia!

Our hearts are pining to see thy shining
Dying our living
To thee are cleaving,
Naught can us sever:
Alleluia!

If God be ours, we fear no powers,
Not of earth or sin or death.
God sees and blesses in worst distresses,
And can change them in a breath.
Wherefore the story tell of God’s glory
With heart and voices;
all Heav’n rejoices,
Singing for ever:
Alleluia!

We shout for gladness, 
Triumph o’er sadness,
Love him and praise him,
And still shall raise him,
Glad hymns forever:
Alleluia!
