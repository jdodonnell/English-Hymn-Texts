Vox clara ecce intonat, 6th cent.;
tr. Edward Caswall (1814-1878) ;
alt. The English Hymnal

Hark! a herald voice is calling:
‘Christ is nigh,’ it seems to say;
‘Cast away the dreams of darkness,
O Ye children of the day’

Startled at the solemn warning
Let the earthbound soul arise;
Christ, her Sun, all sloth dispelling,
Shines upon the morning skies.

Lo! the Lamb, so long expected,
Comes with pardon down from heav’n;
Let us haste, with tears of sorrow,
One and all to be forgiv’n;

So when next he comes with glory,
Wrapping all the earth in fear,
May he then as our defender
On the clouds of heav’n appear.

Honor, glory, virtue, merit,
To the Father and the Son, 
With the co-eternal Spirit,
While unending ages run.
