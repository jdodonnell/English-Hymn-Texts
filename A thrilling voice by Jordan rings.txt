Vox clara ecce intonat, 5th cent.
Advent I. Lauds
tr. John Mason Neale, (1818-1866), 

A thrilling voice by Jordan rings,
Rebuking guilt and darksome things:
Vain dreams of sin and visions fly;
Christ in his might shines forth on high.

Now let each weary soul arise,
That sunk in guilt and wounded lies;
See, the new Star’s refulgent ray
Shall chase disease and sin away.

The Lamb descends from heav’n above
To pardon sin with freest love;
For such indulgent mercy shown,
With tearful joy our thanks we own.

That when again he shines revealed,
And trembling worlds to terror yield,
He give not sin its just reward,
But in his love protect and guard.

To God the Father, God the Son,
And God the Spirit, Three in One,
Praise, honor, might and glory be
From age to age eternally.
