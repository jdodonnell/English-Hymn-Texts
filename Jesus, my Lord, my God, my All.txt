St. 1-2, Frederick William Faber;
St. 3, Mediator Dei Hymnal ©1955 GIA

Jesus, my Lord, my God, my All,
How can I love thee as I ought?
And how revere this wondrous gift,
So far surpassing hope or thought?

Sweet Sacrament, we thee adore!
O make us love thee more and more!
O make us love thee more and more. 

Had I but Mary’s sinless heart,
To love thee with, my dearest King;
O! with what bursts of fervent praise,
Thy goodness, Jesus would I sing.

O! see upon the altar placed
The victim of divinest love!
Let all the earth below adore,
And join the choirs of heav’n above.
