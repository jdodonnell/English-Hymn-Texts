adapted from Regina Caeli, anon., Psallite, 1901

Be joyful, Mary, heavenly Queen, 
Gaude, Maria!
Now let thine eyes with gladness beam.
Alleluia! Laetare, O Maria!

Whom thou didst bear by heavenâ€™s grace,
Gaude Maria!
Did all our guit and sin efface.
Alleluia! Laetare, O Maria!

The Lord is risen from the dead,
Gaude, Maria!
He rose with might, as He had said.
Alleluia! Laetare, O Maria!

O pray to God, thou Virgin fair,
Gaude, Maria!
That he our souls to heaven bear.
Alleluia! Laetare, O Maria!
