Qui procedis ab utroque, Adam of St. Victor, tr. E. Caswall, 1858

Spirit of grace and Union!
Who from the Father and the Son
Dost equally proceed.
Inflame our hearts with holy fire
Our lips with eloquence inspire,
And strengthen us in need.

The Father and the Son through Thee
Are linked in perfect unity
And everlasting love;
Ineffably Thou dost pervade
All nature; and Thyself unsway'd
The whole creation move.

O inexhaustive Fount of light!
How doth Thy radiance put to flight
The darkness of the mind!
The pure are only pure through Thee;
Thou only dost the guilty free,
And cheer with light the blind.

Lord of all sanctity and might!
Immense, immortal, infinite!
The life of earth and Heav'n!
Be, through eternal length of days,
All honor, glory, blessing, praise,
And adoration giv'n!
