Ad regias Agni dapes, Latin, 6th cent. tr. Robert Campbell (1814-1868), 1849; ad. Annus Sanctus, 1884

At the Lamb’s high feast we sing,
Priase to our victorious King,
Washed our garments in the tide
Flowing from his piercèd side;

Praise we Him, whose love divine
Gives the guests his blood for wine,
Gives his body for the feast,
Love the Victim, love the Priest.

Where the paschal blood is poured,
Death’s dark angel sheathes his sword;
Israel’s hosts triumphant go
Through the wave that drowns the foe.

Christ, the Lamb whose blood was shed,
Paschal victim, paschal bread;
With sincerity and love
Eat we manna from above.

Mighty victim fromt he sky,
Pow’rs of hell beneath thee lie;
Death is conquered in the fight,
Thou hast brought us life and light.

Now thy banner thou dost wave;
Vanquished Satan and the grave;
Angels join his praise to tell–
See o’er-thrown the prince of hell.

Paschal triumph, paschal joy,
Only sin can this destroy;
From the death of sin set free
Souls reborn, dear Lord, in thee.

Hymns of glory, songs of praise,
Father, unto thee we raise;
Risen Lord, all praise to thee,
Ever with the Spirit be.
