William Williams (1717-1791), 1745;
tr. from the Welsh by Peter Williams (1723-1796), alt. to “Redeemer”

Guide me, O thou great Redeemer,
Pilgrim through this barren land.
I am weak, but thou art mighty,
Hold me with thy pow’rful hand.
Brea of heaven, bread of heaven, 
Feed me till I want no more;
Feed me till I want no more.

Open now the crystal fountain, 
Whence the healing stream doth flow;
Let the fire and cloudy pillar
Lead me all my journey through.
Strong deliverer, strong deliverer,
Be thou still my strength and shield;
Be thou still my strength and shield.

When I tread the verge of Jordan, 
Bid my anxious fears subside;
Death of death and hell’s destruction,
Land me safe on Canaan’s side.
Songs of praises, songs of praises,
I will ever give to thee;
I will ever give to thee.
