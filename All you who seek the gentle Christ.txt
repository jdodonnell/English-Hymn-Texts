Magi videntes parvulum
Epiphany. Lauds
tr. St. Cecilia’s Abbey, Hymns for the Liturgy of the Hours, 1979

All you who seek the gentle Christ, 
To heaven lift your eyes and see
The sign of glory without end,
Revealing his descent to earth.

This gleaming star outshines by far
The brightness of the sun’s full glow,
For it declares that God made Man
Has come to bless and save us all.

Behold, three sages from the East,
The lands of sunrise and of hope,
Perceive the standard of the King,
And its good tidings read aright.

“What is this wondrous thing?” they say,
“A King who thus commands the stars,
Whom pow’r above adore in fear,
Whom light and heaven’s realm obey.

For we perceive a glory new,
Transcendent, endless, and sublime,
Far older than the skies above,
Unfathomed by the dark abyss.”

He is the King of nations all,
Expected by the Jews of old,
The promised Seed of Abraham,
Born of his race in course of time.

To God the Father, heavenly Light,
To Christ, revealed in earthly might,
To God the Holy Ghost we raise
Our equal and unceasing praise. Amen.
