John Brownlie (1859-1925), Hymns from the East, 1910; based upon the Greek

Let thy Blood in mercy poured,
Let thy gracious Body broken,
Be to me, O gracious Lord
Of thy boundless love the token;

Thou didst give thyself for me,
Now I give myself to thee.

Thou didst die that I might live;
Blessed Lord thou camâ€™st to save me;
All that love of God could give,
Jesus by his sorrows gave me;

By the thorns that crowned thy brow,
By the spear wound and the nailing;
By the pain and death I now
Claim, O Christ, thy love unfailing;

Wilt thou own the gift I bring?
All my penitence I give thee;
Thou art my exalted King,
Of thy matchless love forgive me;
