Ecce panis angelorum, Thomas Aquinas;
tr. cento, The English Hymnal, 1906

Lo! the Angels’ Food is given
To the pilgrim who hath striven;
See the children’s Bread from heaven,
Which to dogs may not be cast.

Truth the ancient types fulfilling,
Isaac bound, a victim willing,
Paschal lamb, its life-blood spilling,
Manna sent in ages past.
