Psalm 23
George Herbert (1593-1632)

The God of love my Shepherd is, 
  And he that doth me feed;
While he is mine and I am his,
  What can I want or need?

He leads me to the tender grass,
  Where I both feed and rest;
Then to the streams that gently pass:
  In both I have the best.

Or if I stray, he doth convert,
  And bring my mind in frame,
And all this not for my desert,
  But for his holy name.

Yea, in deathâ€™s shady black abode
  Well may I walk, not fear;
For thou art with me, and thy rod
  To guide, thy staff to bear.

Surely thy sweet and wondrous love
  Shall measure all my days;
And as it never shall remove
  So neither shall my praise.
