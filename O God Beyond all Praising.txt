v. 3. Gott Vater! sei gepriesen, anon.; tr. Edward C. Currie, 1958

O God beyond all praising,
We worship you today
And sing the love amazing 
That songs cannot repay
For we can only wonder
At every gift you send,
At blessings without number
And mercies without end:
We lift our hearts before you
And wait upon your word:
We honor and adore you
Our great and mighty Lord.

Then hear, O gracious Savior,
Accept he love we bring.
That we who know your favor, 
May serve you as our king.
And whether our tomorrows 
Be filled with good or ill,
We’ll triumph through our sorrows
And rise to bless you still:
To marvel at your beauty
And glory in your ways,
And make a joyful duty 
Our sacrifice of praise.

O God, Almighty Father, 
Creator of all things,
The heavens stand in wonder,
While earth your glory sings;
O Jesus, Word Incarnate, Redeemer most adored,
All glory, praise and honor 
Be yours, o sovereign Lord;
O God, the Holy Spirit,
Who lives within our soul,
Send forth your light and lead us
To our eternal goal!
