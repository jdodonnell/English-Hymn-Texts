Iesu, nostra redemptio
Ascension. Vespers

tr. Thomas J. Potter

Hail, thou who man’s Redeemer art,
Jesus, the joy of ev’ry heart;
Great Maker of the world’s wide frame,
And purest love’s delight and flame.

What nameless mercy thee o’er-came,
To bear our load of sin and shame?
For guiltless, thou thy life didst give,
That sinful, erring man might live.

The realms of woe are forced by thee,
Its captives from their chains set free;
And thou, amid the ransomed train,
At God’s right hand dost victor reign.

Let mercy sweet with thee prevail,
To cure the wounds we now bewail;
Oh, bless us with thy holy sight,
And fill us with eternal light.

Be thou our joy and thou our guard,
Who art to be our great reward;
Our glory and our boast in thee
For ever and for ever be. Amen.
