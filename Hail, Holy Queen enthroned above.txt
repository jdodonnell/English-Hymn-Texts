Salve Regina caelitum; 
tr. traditional, adapt. by M. Owen Lee

Hail, Holy Queen enthroned above, O Maria.
Hail, Queen of mercy and of love, O Maria. 
Trumph, all ye Cherubim,
Sing with us, ye Seraphim,
Heav’n and earth resound the hymn:

Salve, Salve, Salve Regina.

The cause of joy to men below, O Maria.
The spring through which all graces flow, O Maria.
Angels, all your praises bring,
Earth and heaven, with us sing,
All creation echoing: 

O gentle, loving, holy one, O Maria.
The God of light became your Son, O Maria.
Triumph, all ye Cherubim, 
Sing with us, ye Seraphim,
Heav’n and earth resound the hymn:
