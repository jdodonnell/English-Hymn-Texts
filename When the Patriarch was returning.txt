Haste dum victo triumphans
Corpus Christi. (or Christ the Priest)
tr. Edward Caswall

When the Patriarch was returning 
Crown'd with triumph from the fray, 
Him the peaceful king of Salem 
Came to meet upon his way; 
Meekly bearing Bread and Wine, 
Holy Priesthood's awful sign ! 

On the truth thus dimly shadow'd, 
Later days a lustre shed ; 
When the great High-Priest eternal, 
Under forms of Wine and Bread, 
For the world's immortal food, 
Gave His Flesh and gave His Blood. 

Wond'rous Gift! — The Word who moulded 
All things by His might divine, 
Bread into His Body changes, 
Into His own Blood the wine ; — 
What though sense no change perceives, 
Faith admires, adores, believes ! 

He who once to die a Victim 
On the Cross, did not refuse, 
Day by day, upon our altars, 
That same Sacrifice renews ;
Through His holy Priesthood's hands, 
Faithful to His last commands ! 

While, the people all uniting 
In the Sacrifice sublime, 
Offer Christ to His high Father, 
Offer up themselves with Him; 
Then together with the Priest 
On the living Victim feast ! 

{
Laud and honor to the Father
Laud and honor to the Son
Laud and honor to the Spirit,
Ever Three and ever One
Consubstantial, Coeternal,
While unending ages run. Amen.
}

[
Praise the Universal Maker,
Father of the world of men;
Praise the Son, whose life-blood flowing
Bought our captive souls again;
Gracious Breath of Life Divine -
Praise, O Triune God, be Thine ! Amen.
