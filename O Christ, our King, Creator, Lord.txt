Rex Christe, factor omnium, Gregory the Great (d. 604)
tr. Ray Palmer (1808-1887), 1858

O Christ, our King, Creator, Lord,
Savior of all who trust thy Word,
To them who seek thee ever near,
Now to our praises bend thine ear.

In thy dear Cross a grace is found-
It flows from ev’ry streaming wound-
Whose power our inbred sin controls,
Breaks the firm bond, and frees our souls.

Thou didst create the stars of night;
Yet thou hast veiled in flesh thy light,
Hast deigned a mortal form to wear,
a mortal’s painful lot to bear.

When thou didst hang upon the Tree
The quaking earth acknowledged thee;
When thou didst there yield up thy breath,
The world grew dark as shades of death.

Now in the Father’s glory high,
Great Conqueror, never more to die,
Us by thy mighty power defend, 
And reign through ages without end.
