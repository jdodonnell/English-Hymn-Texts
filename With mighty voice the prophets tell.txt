Magnis prophetae vocibus
Advent II. Lauds
tr. William Dotson (1986- ), © 2010

With mighty voice the prophets tell
That Christ will come with us to dwell;
His way prepared by healing grace
By which he saved our fallen race.

And when that faithful voice goes forth,
Announcing grace has come to earth,
The morning breaks with newborn light,
And all our hearts with joy are bright.

When first he came by virgin birth,
He did not come to judge the earth,
But heal the wound that sin had make,
Whate’er was lost and dead to save.

He warned that he would come once more
And now stands waiting at the door,
His heav’nly reign to welcome in,
His saints to crown on high with him.

New light is promised form on high,
Salvation’s star now fills the sky;
Its splendor calls us in the night
To set our ways and lives aright.

O Christ, the sun we long to see,
Our God, who reigns eternally,
May we see you and always raise
Our never-ending hymn of praise.
