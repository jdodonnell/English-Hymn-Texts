Anon., English, c. 1757

Come, thou Almighty King,
Help us thy name to sing,
Help us to praise,
Father all-glorious
O’er all victorious, 
Come and reign over us,
Ancient of Days!

Come, thou Incarnate Word,
Gird on thy mighty sword,
Our prayers attend!
Come and thy people bless,
And give thy Word success,
Spirit of holiness
On us descend!

Come, Holy Comforter,
Thy Sacred witness bear,
In this glad hour!
Thou who almighty art,
Now rule in ev’ry heart,
And ne’er form us depart,
Spirit of power!

To the great One in Three
Eternal praises be
Hence evermore!
His sovereign majesty 
May we in glory see,
And to eternity
Love and adore!
