Charles Wesley (1707-1788), 1739, and Thomas Cotterill (1779-1823)

Hail the day that sees him rise,
To his throne above the skies,
Christ, awhile to mortals giv’n,
Reascends his native heav’n,

There the glorious triumph waits,
Lift your heads, eternal gates,
Christ hath conquered death and sin,
Take the King of glory in,

Circled round with angel pow’rs,
Their triumphant Lord, and ours,
Conqu’ror over death and sin,
“Take the King of glory in!”

See! the heaven its Lord receives,
Still he loves the earth he leaves,
Though returning to his throne,
Still he calls mankind his own,

Still for us he intercedes,
His prevailing death he pleads,
Near himself prepares our place,
Harbinger of human race,
There we shall with thee remain,
Partners of thy endless reign,
There thy face unclouded see,
Find our heav’n of heav’ns in thee!
