Cecil Francis Alexander (1818-1895), 1846, alt.

He is risen, he is risen!
Tell it out with joyful voice:
He has burst his three days’ prison;
Let the whole wide earth rejoice:
Death is conquered, man is free,
Christ has won the victory.

Come, ye sad and fearful-hearted,
With glad smile and radiant brow:
Lent’s long shadows have departed;
All his woes are over now,
And the Passion that he bore:
Sin and pain can vex no more.

Come, with high and holy hymning,
Chant our Lord’s triumphant lay;
Not one darksome cloud is dimming
Yonder glorious morning ray,
Breaking o’er the purple east,
Symbol of our Easter feast.

He is risen, he is risen!
He hath opened heaven’s gate:
We are free from sin’s dark prison
Risen to a holier state;
And a brighter Easter beam 
On our longing eyes shall stream.
