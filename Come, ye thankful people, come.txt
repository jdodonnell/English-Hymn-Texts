Henry Alford, 1865

Come, ye thankful people, come,
Raise the song of Havest-home:
All is safely gathered in,
Ere the winter storms begin:
God our Maker doth provide
For our wants to be supplied:–
Come to God’s own temple, come, 
Raise the song of Harvest-home!

We ourselves are God’s own field, 
Fruit unto his praise to yield;
Wheat and tares together sown,
Unto joy or sorrow grown:
First the blade, and then the ear,
Then the full corn shall appear:
Grant, O harvest Lord, that we
Wholesome grain and pure may be.

For the Lord our God shall come,
And shall take his harvest home;
From his field shall in that day
All offences purge away;
Give his angels charge at last
In the fire the tares to cast;
But the fruitful ears to sore
In his garner evermore.

Then, thou Church triumphant, come,
Raise the song of Harvest-home!
All are safely gathered in,
Free form sorrow, free from sin;
There, for ever purified,
In God’s garner to abide:
Come, ten thousand angels, come,
Raise the glorious Harvest-home!
