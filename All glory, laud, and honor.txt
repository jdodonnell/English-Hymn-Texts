Gloria, laus, et honor, Palm Sunday Procession, tr. J.M. Neale, Hymns Ancient and Modern

All glory, laud, and honour
To Thee, Redeemer, King,
To whom the lips of children
Made sweet hosannas ring.


Thou art the King of Israel,
Thou David's royal Son,
Who in the Lord's name comest,
The King and Bless√®d One.

The company of Angels
Are praising Thee on high,
And mortal men and all things
Created make reply.

The people of the He brews
With palms to meet Thee went:
Our praise and pray'r and anthems
Before Thee we present.

To Thee before Thy Passion
They sang their hymns of praise;
To Thee now high exalted
Our melody we raise.

Thou didst accept their praises,
Accept the praise we bring,
Who in all good delightest,
Thou good and gracious King.
