John Mason (c. 1600-1672), c. 1683

How shall I sing that Majesty
Which Angels do admire?
Let dust in dust and silence lie;
Sing, sing, ye heav’nly choir.
Thousands of thousands stand around
Thy throne, O God most high;
Ten thousand times ten thousand sound
Thy praise; but who am I?

Thy brightness unto them appears,
Whilst I thy footsteps trace;
A sound of God comes to my ears,
But they behold thy face.
They sing because thou art their Sun;
Lord, send a beam on me;
For where heaven is once begun
There Alleluyas be.

Enlighten with faith’s light my heart,
Inflame it with love’s fire;
Then shall I sing an bear a part
With that celestial choir.
I shall, I fear, be dark and cold,
With all my fire and light;
Yet when thou dost accept their gold,
Lord, treasure up my mite.

How great a being, Lord, is thine,
Which doth a beings keep!
Thy knowledge is the only line
To sound so vast a deep.
Thou art a sea without a shore,
A sun without a sphere;
Thy time is now and evermore,
Thy place is ev’rywhere.
