Herr Christ der einig, Elizabeth Cruciger, (c.1500-1535), 1524
tr. Arthur Tozer Russell, (1806-1874), Psalms and Hymns, 1851, alt.

The only Son from heaven,
  By prophets long foretold,
Now by he Father given,
  His glory doth unfold.
No bound His light confineth;
No star so brightly shineth,
  As He our Morning Star.

Lo! in the time appointed,
  Christ of the Virgin born,
Our King of God anointed:
  O Bright and holy morn!
The power of death He breaketh;
Man of Hi heaven partaketh,-
  an heir of life again.

O Lord, our hearts awaken
  To know and love Thee more,-
In faith to stand unshaken,-
 In spirit to adore;
That we whilst onward hasting,
O Lord, Thy sweetness tasting,
  May ever thirst for Thee.


alt. Lutheran Hymnary, 1913

The only Son from heaven,
    Foretold by ancient seers,
By God, the Father, given,
    In human shape appears;
No sphere His light confining,
No star so brightly shining
    As He, our Morning Star.

O time of God appointed,
    O bright and holy morn!
He come the King anointed,
    The Christ, the virgin-born;
His home on earth He maketh,
And man of heav’n partaketh,
    Of life again an heir.

O Lord, our hearts awaken,
    To know and love Thee more,
In faith to stand unshaken,
    In Spirit to adore,
That we still heav’n-ward hasting,
Yet here Thy joy foretasting,
    May reap its fullness there.
