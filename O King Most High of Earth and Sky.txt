Supreme Rector caelitum, 17th cent.; tr. W.J. Blew

O King most high of eartha nd sky
On prostrate death thou treats,
And with thy Blood dost mark the road
Whereby to heaven thou leased.

O Lord of Love, enthroned above
Beside the Almighty Father,
Thou wilt not leave thy folk to grieve,
But to Thyself wilt gather.

O Christ, behold thine orphaned fold,
Which thou hast born with anguish,
Steeped in the tide from thy rent side:
O leave us not to languish!

The glorious gain of all thy pain
Henceforth dost thou inherit;
Now comes the hour, then gently shower
On us thy promised Spirit!

Dear Lord, to thee all glory be,
Thy Fatherâ€™s throne ascending:
Thy reign as One and Three shall run
Through ages never ending.
