Charles Wesley (1707-1788), 1758

Lo! he comes with clouds descending,
Once for favored sinners slain;
Thousand thousand saints attending,
Swell the triumph of his train:
Hallelujah!
God appears on earth to reign.

Ev’ry eye shall now behold him
Robed in dreadful majesty;
Those who set at naught and sold him,
Pierced and nailed him to the tree,
Deeply wailing,
Shall the true Messiah see.

The dear tokens of his passion
Still his dazzling body bears;
Cause of endless exultation
To his ransomed worshippers;
With what rapture,
Gaze we on those glorious scars!

Yea, Amen! let all adore thee,
High on thine eternal throne;
Savior, take the pow’r and glory,
Claim the kingdom for thine own;
O come quickly!
Everlasting God, come down!
