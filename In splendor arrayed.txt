In splendor arrayed,
In vesture of gold,
The Mother of God
In glory behold!
O Daughter of David,
Thou dwellest on high,
Excelling in brightness 
The hosts of the sky.

O Maiden thou art
A Mother renowned;
A Mother who yet
As Virgin art crowned;
The Lord of the Angels,
God high and supreme,
Took flesh of thy substance, the world to redeem.

All kindreds and tongues
Thine Offspring adore,
Creation must bow
His footstool before;
At thy gentle pleadings May he form his height
Disperse all our shadows
And fill us with light.

The Father we praise,
Who chose for his Son
A Mother all-pure,
Thâ€™immaculate one.
All praise to her off-spring
Who saveth our race;
Like praise to the Spirit,
Who filled her with grace.
