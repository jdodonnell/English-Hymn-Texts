Ave verum corpus;
tr. J Oxenham ()

Hail, true Body of the Savior, 
Spotless Mary’s Virgin birth!
Slain upon the cross to cleanse us
By his pains from sins of earth.

Hear us, merciful and gracious,
O sweet Jesus, Mary’s Child.

From Whose side for sinners piercèd,
Water flowed and mingled glood,
May’st thou, dearest Lord, be given 
In death’s hour to be our food.
