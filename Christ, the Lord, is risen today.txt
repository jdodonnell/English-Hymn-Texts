Charles Wesley (1707-1788), 1739

Christ, the Lord, is ris’n today, Alleluia!
Sons of men and angels say! Alleluia!
Raise your joys and triumphs high, Alleluia!
Sing, ye heavens and earth reply. Alleluia!

Love’s redeeming work is done, Alleluia!
Fought the fight, the battle won; Alleluia!
Le! our Sun’s eclipse is o’er, Alleluia!
Lo! he sets in blood no more. Alleluia!

Vain the stone, the watch, the seal, Alleluia!
Christ hath burst the gates of hell: Alleluia!
Death in vain forbids his rise, Alleluia!
Christ hath opened paradise. Alleluia!

Lives again our glorious King, Alleluia!
Where, O death, is now thy sting? Alleluia!
Once he died our souls to save, Alleluia!
Where thy victory, O grave? Alleluia!
