Verbum salutis omnium
Advent II. Vespers
Dylan Schrader (1985- ), © 2010

The Father speaks a Word to save
All men and women from the grave.
O Virgin blest, dispel our gloom;
Receive him in your maiden womb.

The Spirit’s shade, from heaven’s height,
Has filled you with his living light
That Christ the Lord you now may bear,
The Father’s equal and his heir.

This is the Gate, that long was barred
The sacred Temple safe to guard,
Its blessed entrance opening
Only for heaven’s highest King.

To prophets promised from afar
And born before the morning star,
Now Gabriel proclaims his birth;
The Lord of heaven come to earth.

All peoples, leap for joy and raise,
With angels, shouts of gladsome praise;
The Highest comes this humble way
To save us, who had gone astray.

To God the Father, glory sing,
And praise to Christ, most kingly King;
The Spirit Paraclete we praise
For ever and for endless days.
