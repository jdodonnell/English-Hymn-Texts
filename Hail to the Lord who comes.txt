John Ellerton (1826-1893), 1880

Hail to the Lord who comes,
Comes to his temple gate!
Not with his Angel host,
Not in his kingly state;
No shouts proclaim him nigh,
No crowds his coming wait;

But borne upon the throne
Of Mary’s gentle breast,
Watched by her duteous love,
In her fond arms at rest;
Thus to his Father’s house
He comes, the heav’nly Guest.

There Joseph at her side
In rev’rent wonder stand;
And, filled with holy joy,
Old Simeon in his hands
Takes up the promised Child,
The glory of all lands.

Hail to the great First-born
Whose ransom-price they pay!
The Son before all worlds, 
The Child of man today,
That he might ransom us
Who still in bondage lay.

O Light of all the earth, 
Thy children wait for thee!
Come to thy temples here,
That we, from sin set free,
Before thy Father’s face
May all presented be!
